    "A statistical language model is learned from raw text and predicts the probability of the next word in the sequence given the words already present in the sequence. Language models are a key component in larger models for challenging NLP problems, like machine translation and speech recognition. They can also be developed as standalone models and used for generating new sequences that have the same statistical properties as the source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models both learn and predict one word at a time. the training of the network involves providing sequences of words as input that are processed one at a time where a prediction can be made and learned for each input sequence. Similarly, when making predictions, the process can be seeded with one or few words, then predicted words can be gathered and presented as input on subsequent predictions in order to build up a generated output sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, each model will involce splitting the source text into input and output sequences, such that the model can learn to predict words. There are many ways to frame the sequences from a source text for language modeling."
