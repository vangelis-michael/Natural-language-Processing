      "INTRODUCTION AND ANALYSIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Republic of Plato is the longest of his works with the exception\n",
      "of the Laws, and is certainly the greatest of them. There are nearer\n",
      "approaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist; the\n",
      "Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions of\n",
      "the State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art, the\n",
      "Symposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence. But no other\n",
      "Dialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same perfection\n",
      "of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world, or contains\n",
      "more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and not of one age\n",
      "only but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper irony or a greater\n",
      "wealth of humour or imagery, or more dramatic power. Nor in any other of\n",
      "his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and speculation, or\n",
      "to connect politics with philosophy. The Republic is the centre around\n",
      "which the other Dialogues may be grouped; here philosophy reaches the\n",
      "highest point (cp, especially in Books V, VI, VII) to which ancient\n",
      "thinkers ever attained. Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the\n",
      "moderns, was the first who conceived a method of knowledge, although\n",
      "neither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from\n",
      "the substance of truth; and both of them had to be content with an\n",
      "abstraction of science which was not yet realized. He was the greatest\n",
      "metaphysical genius whom the world has seen; and in him, more than in\n",
      "any other ancient thinker, the germs of future knowledge are contained.\n",
      "The sciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many\n",
      "instruments of thought to after-ages, are based upon the analyses\n",
      "of Socrates and Plato. The principles of definition, the law of\n",
      "contradiction, the fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction\n",
      "between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion, between means\n",
      "and ends, between causes and conditions; also the division of the mind\n",
      "into the rational, concupiscent, and irascible elements, or of pleasures\n",
      "and desires into necessary and unnecessary--these and other great\n",
      "forms of thought are all of them to be found in the Republic, and were\n",
      "probably first invented by Plato. The greatest of all logical truths,\n",
      "and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight,\n",
      "the difference between words and things, has been most strenuously\n",
      "insisted on by him (cp. Rep.; Polit.; Cratyl. 435, 436 ff), although he\n",
      "has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings (e.g.\n",
      "Rep.). But he does not bind up truth in logical formulae,--logic is\n",
      "still veiled in metaphysics; and the science which he imagines to\n",
      "'contemplate all truth and all existence' is very unlike the doctrine of\n",
      "the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered (Soph. Elenchi,\n",
      "33. 18).\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of a\n",
      "still larger design which was to have included an ideal history of\n",
      "Athens, as well as a political and physical philosophy. The fragment of\n",
      "the Critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only in\n",
      "importance to the tale of Troy and the legend of Arthur; and is said as\n",
      "a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth\n",
      "century. This mythical tale, of which the subject was a history of the\n",
      "wars of the Athenians against the Island of Atlantis, is supposed to be\n",
      "founded upon an unfinished poem of Solon, to which it would have stood\n",
      "in the same relation as the writings of the logographers to the poems of\n",
      "Homer. It would have told of a struggle for Liberty (cp. Tim. 25 C), intended\n",
      "to represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas. We may judge from the\n",
      "noble commencement of the Timaeus, from the fragment of the Critias\n",
      "itself, and from the third book of the Laws, in what manner Plato would\n",
      "have treated this high argument. We can only guess why the great design\n",
      "was abandoned; perhaps because Plato became sensible of some incongruity\n",
      "in a fictitious history, or because he had lost his interest in it, or\n",
      "because advancing years forbade the completion of it; and we may please\n",
      "ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative ever been\n",
      "finished, we should have found Plato himself sympathising with the\n",
      "struggle for Hellenic independence (cp. Laws  iii. 698 ff.), singing a\n",
      "hymn of triumph over Marathon and Salamis, perhaps making the reflection\n",
      "of Herodotus (v. 78) where he contemplates the growth of the Athenian\n",
      "empire--'How brave a thing is freedom of speech, which has made the\n",
      "Athenians so far exceed every other state of Hellas in greatness!' or,\n",
      "more probably, attributing the victory to the ancient good order of\n",
      "Athens and to the favor of Apollo and Athene (cp. Introd. to Critias).\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, Plato may be regarded as the 'captain' ('arhchegoz') or leader\n",
      "of a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found the\n",
      "original of Cicero's De Republica, of St. Augustine's City of God,\n",
      "of the Utopia of Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary\n",
      "States which are framed upon the same model. The extent to which\n",
      "Aristotle or the Aristotelian school were indebted to him in the\n",
      "Politics has been little recognised, and the recognition is the\n",
      "more necessary because it is not made by Aristotle himself. The two\n",
      "philosophers had more in common than they were conscious of; and\n",
      "probably some elements of Plato remain still undetected in Aristotle. In\n",
      "English philosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in the\n",
      "works of the Cambridge Platonists, but in great original writers like\n",
      "Berkeley or Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas. That there is a truth\n",
      "higher than experience, of which the mind bears witness to herself, is\n",
      "a conviction which in our own generation has been enthusiastically\n",
      "asserted, and is perhaps gaining ground. Of the Greek authors who at the\n",
      "Renaissance brought a new life into the world Plato has had the greatest\n",
      "influence. The Republic of Plato is also the first treatise upon\n",
      "education, of which the writings of Milton and Locke, Rousseau, Jean\n",
      "Paul, and Goethe are the legitimate descendants. Like Dante or Bunyan,\n",
      "he has a revelation of another life; like Bacon, he is profoundly\n",
      "impressed with the unity of knowledge; in the early Church he exercised\n",
      "a real influence on theology, and at the Revival of Literature on\n",
      "politics. Even the fragments of his words when 'repeated at second-hand'\n",
      "(Symp. 215 D) have in all ages ravished the hearts of men, who have seen\n",
      "reflected in them their own higher nature. He is the father of idealism\n",
      "in philosophy, in politics, in literature. And many of the latest\n",
      "conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen, such as the unity of\n",
      "knowledge, the reign of law, and the equality of the sexes, have been\n",
      "anticipated in a dream by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, the nature\n",
      "of which is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just and blameless old\n",
      "man--then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates and\n",
      "Polemarchus--then caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained\n",
      "by Socrates--reduced to an abstraction by Glaucon and Adeimantus, and\n",
      "having become invisible in the individual reappears at length in the\n",
      "ideal State which is constructed by Socrates. The first care of the\n",
      "rulers is to be education, of which an outline is drawn after the old\n",
      "Hellenic model, providing only for an improved religion and morality,\n",
      "and more simplicity in music and gymnastic, a manlier strain of poetry,\n",
      "and greater harmony of the individual and the State. We are thus led on\n",
      "to the conception of a higher State, in which 'no man calls anything his\n",
      "own,' and in which there is neither 'marrying nor giving in marriage,'\n",
      "and 'kings are philosophers' and 'philosophers are kings;' and there\n",
      "is another and higher education, intellectual as well as moral and\n",
      "religious, of science as well as of art, and not of youth only but of\n",
      "the whole of life. Such a State is hardly to be realized in this world\n",
      "and quickly degenerates. To the perfect ideal succeeds the government\n",
      "of the soldier and the lover of honour, this again declining into\n",
      "democracy, and democracy into tyranny, in an imaginary but regular order\n",
      "having not much resemblance to the actual facts. When 'the wheel has\n",
      "come full circle' we do not begin again with a new period of human life;\n",
      "but we have passed from the best to the worst, and there we end. The\n",
      "subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy\n",
      "which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of the Republic\n",
      "is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion. Poetry is discovered to\n",
      "be an imitation thrice removed from the truth, and Homer, as well as\n",
      "the dramatic poets, having been condemned as an imitator, is sent into\n",
      "banishment along with them. And the idea of the State is supplemented by\n",
      "the revelation of a future life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The division into books, like all similar divisions (Cp. Sir G.C. Lewis\n",
      "in the Classical Museum, vol. ii. p 1.), is probably later than the age of Plato. The\n",
      "natural divisions are five in number;--(1) Book I and the first half\n",
      "of Book II down to the paragraph beginning, 'I had always admired the\n",
      "genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus,' which is introductory; the first\n",
      "book containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical notions of\n",
      "justice, and concluding, like some of the earlier Dialogues, without\n",
      "arriving at any definite result. To this is appended a restatement of\n",
      "the nature of justice according to common opinion, and an answer is\n",
      "demanded to the question--What is justice, stripped of appearances? The\n",
      "second division (2) includes the remainder of the second and the whole\n",
      "of the third and fourth books, which are mainly occupied with the\n",
      "construction of the first State and the first education. The third\n",
      "division (3) consists of the fifth, sixth, and seventh books, in which\n",
      "philosophy rather than justice is the subject of enquiry, and the\n",
      "second State is constructed on principles of communism and ruled by\n",
      "philosophers, and the contemplation of the idea of good takes the place\n",
      "of the social and political virtues. In the eighth and ninth books (4)\n",
      "the perversions of States and of the individuals who correspond to them\n",
      "are reviewed in succession; and the nature of pleasure and the principle\n",
      "of tyranny are further analysed in the individual man. The tenth book\n",
      "(5) is the conclusion of the whole, in which the relations of philosophy\n",
      "to poetry are finally determined, and the happiness of the citizens\n",
      "in this life, which has now been assured, is crowned by the vision of\n",
      "another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or a more general division into two parts may be adopted; the first\n",
      "(Books I - IV) containing the description of a State framed generally in\n",
      "accordance with Hellenic notions of religion and morality, while in the\n",
      "second (Books V - X) the Hellenic State is transformed into an\n",
      "ideal kingdom of philosophy, of which all other governments are the\n",
      "perversions. These two points of view are really opposed, and the\n",
      "opposition is only veiled by the genius of Plato. The Republic, like\n",
      "the Phaedrus (see Introduction to Phaedrus), is an imperfect whole; the\n",
      "higher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the\n",
      "Hellenic temple, which at last fades away into the heavens. Whether this\n",
      "imperfection of structure arises from an enlargement of the plan;\n",
      "or from the imperfect reconcilement in the writer's own mind of the\n",
      "struggling elements of thought which are now first brought together\n",
      "by him; or, perhaps, from the composition of the work at different\n",
      "times--are questions, like the similar question about the Iliad and\n",
      "the Odyssey, which are worth asking, but which cannot have a distinct\n",
      "answer. In the age of Plato there was no regular mode of publication,\n",
      "and an author would have the less scruple in altering or adding to a\n",
      "work which was known only to a few of his friends. There is no absurdity\n",
      "in supposing that he may have laid his labours aside for a time, or\n",
      "turned from one work to another; and such interruptions would be more\n",
      "likely to occur in the case of a long than of a short writing. In all\n",
      "attempts to determine the chronological order of the Platonic writings\n",
      "on internal evidence, this uncertainty about any single Dialogue being\n",
      "composed at one time is a disturbing element, which must be admitted\n",
      "to affect longer works, such as the Republic and the Laws, more than\n",
      "shorter ones. But, on the other hand, the seeming discrepancies of\n",
      "the Republic may only arise out of the discordant elements which the\n",
      "philosopher has attempted to unite in a single whole, perhaps without\n",
      "being himself able to recognise the inconsistency which is obvious to\n",
      "us. For there is a judgment of after ages which few great writers have\n",
      "ever been able to anticipate for themselves. They do not perceive the\n",
      "want of connexion in their own writings, or the gaps in their systems\n",
      "which are visible enough to those who come after them. In the beginnings\n",
      "of literature and philosophy, amid the first efforts of thought and\n",
      "language, more inconsistencies occur than now, when the paths of\n",
      "speculation are well worn and the meaning of words precisely defined.\n",
      "For consistency, too, is the growth of time; and some of the greatest\n",
      "creations of the human mind have been wanting in unity. Tried by this\n",
      "test, several of the Platonic Dialogues, according to our modern ideas,\n",
      "appear to be defective, but the deficiency is no proof that they were\n",
      "composed at different times or by different hands. And the supposition\n",
      "that the Republic was written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort\n",
      "is in some degree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of\n",
      "the work to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second title, 'Concerning Justice,' is not the one by which the\n",
      "Republic is quoted, either by Aristotle or generally in antiquity, and,\n",
      "like the other second titles of the Platonic Dialogues, may therefore be\n",
      "assumed to be of later date. Morgenstern and others have asked\n",
      "whether the definition of justice, which is the professed aim, or the\n",
      "construction of the State is the principal argument of the work. The\n",
      "answer is, that the two blend in one, and are two faces of the same\n",
      "truth; for justice is the order of the State, and the State is the\n",
      "visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human society. The\n",
      "one is the soul and the other is the body, and the Greek ideal of the\n",
      "State, as of the individual, is a fair mind in a fair body. In Hegelian\n",
      "phraseology the state is the reality of which justice is the idea. Or,\n",
      "described in Christian language, the kingdom of God is within, and yet\n",
      "developes into a Church or external kingdom; 'the house not made with\n",
      "hands, eternal in the heavens,' is reduced to the proportions of an\n",
      "earthly building. Or, to use a Platonic image, justice and the State are\n",
      "the warp and the woof which run through the whole texture. And when the\n",
      "constitution of the State is completed, the conception of justice is not\n",
      "dismissed, but reappears under the same or different names throughout\n",
      "the work, both as the inner law of the individual soul, and finally as\n",
      "the principle of rewards and punishments in another life. The virtues\n",
      "are based on justice, of which common honesty in buying and selling\n",
      "is the shadow, and justice is based on the idea of good, which is the\n",
      "harmony of the world, and is reflected both in the institutions of\n",
      "states and in motions of the heavenly bodies (cp. Tim. 47). The Timaeus,\n",
      "which takes up the political rather than the ethical side of the\n",
      "Republic, and is chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward\n",
      "world, yet contains many indications that the same law is supposed to\n",
      "reign over the State, over nature, and over man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too much, however, has been made of this question both in ancient and\n",
      "modern times. There is a stage of criticism in which all works, whether\n",
      "of nature or of art, are referred to design. Now in ancient writings,\n",
      "and indeed in literature generally, there remains often a large element\n",
      "which was not comprehended in the original design. For the plan grows\n",
      "under the author's hand; new thoughts occur to him in the act of\n",
      "writing; he has not worked out the argument to the end before he begins.\n",
      "The reader who seeks to find some one idea under which the whole may be\n",
      "conceived, must necessarily seize on the vaguest and most general. Thus\n",
      "Stallbaum, who is dissatisfied with the ordinary explanations of the\n",
      "argument of the Republic, imagines himself to have found the true\n",
      "argument 'in the representation of human life in a State perfected by\n",
      "justice, and governed according to the idea of good.' There may be some\n",
      "use in such general descriptions, but they can hardly be said to express\n",
      "the design of the writer. The truth is, that we may as well speak of\n",
      "many designs as of one; nor need anything be excluded from the plan of\n",
      "a great work to which the mind is naturally led by the association of\n",
      "ideas, and which does not interfere with the general purpose. What kind\n",
      "or degree of unity is to be sought after in a building, in the plastic\n",

      "music and gymnastic to the end of the book. It is Adeimantus again\n",
      "who volunteers the criticism of common sense on the Socratic method of\n",
      "argument, and who refuses to let Socrates pass lightly over the question\n",
      "of women and children. It is Adeimantus who is the respondent in the\n",
      "more argumentative, as Glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative\n",
      "portions of the Dialogue. For example, throughout the greater part\n",

      "seriously. But in the sixth book his enmity towards the Sophists abates;\n",

      "to me oftener, Socrates, for I am too old to go to you; and at my time\n",
      "of life, having lost other pleasures, I care the more for conversation.'\n",
      "Socrates asks him what he thinks of age, to which the old man replies,\n",
      "that the sorrows and discontents of age are to be attributed to the\n",
      "tempers of men, and that age is a time of peace in which the tyranny\n",
      "of the passions is no longer felt. Yes, replies Socrates, but the world\n",
      "will say, Cephalus, that you are happy in old age because you are rich.\n",
      "'And there is something in what they say, Socrates, but not so much as\n",
      "they imagine--as Themistocles replied to the Seriphian, \"Neither you, if\n",
      "you had been an Athenian, nor I, if I had been a Seriphian, would ever\n",
      "have been famous,\" I might in like manner reply to you, Neither a good\n",
      "poor man can be happy in age, nor yet a bad rich man.' Socrates remarks\n",
      "that Cephalus appears not to care about riches, a quality which he\n",
      "ascribes to his having inherited, not acquired them, and would like\n",
      "to know what he considers to be the chief advantage of them. Cephalus\n",
      "answers that when you are old the belief in the world below grows upon\n",
      "you, and then to have done justice and never to have been compelled to\n",
      "do injustice through poverty, and never to have deceived anyone, are\n",
      "felt to be unspeakable blessings. Socrates, who is evidently preparing\n",
      "for an argument, next asks, What is the meaning of the word justice? To\n",
      "tell the truth and pay your debts? No more than this? Or must we admit\n",
      "exceptions? Ought I, for example, to put back into the hands of my\n",
      "friend, who has gone mad, the sword which I borrowed of him when he\n",
      "was in his right mind? 'There must be exceptions.' 'And yet,' says\n",
      "Polemarchus, 'the definition which has been given has the authority\n",
      "of Simonides.' Here Cephalus retires to look after the sacrifices,\n",
      "and bequeaths, as Socrates facetiously remarks, the possession of the\n",
      "argument to his heir, Polemarchus...\n",
      "\n",
      "The description of old age is finished, and Plato, as his manner is, has\n",
      "touched the key-note of the whole work in asking for the definition of\n",
      "justice, first suggesting the question which Glaucon afterwards pursues\n",
      "respecting external goods, and preparing for the concluding mythus of\n",
      "the world below in the slight allusion of Cephalus. The portrait of the\n",
      "just man is a natural frontispiece or introduction to the long discourse\n",
      "which follows, and may perhaps imply that in all our perplexity about\n",
      "the nature of justice, there is no difficulty in discerning 'who is\n",
      "a just man.' The first explanation has been supported by a saying of\n",
      "Simonides; and now Socrates has a mind to show that the resolution of\n",
      "justice into two unconnected precepts, which have no common principle,\n",
      "fails to satisfy the demands of dialectic.\n",
      "\n",
      "...He proceeds: What did Simonides mean by this saying of his? Did he\n",
      "mean that I was to give back arms to a madman? 'No, not in that case,\n",
      "not if the parties are friends, and evil would result. He meant that you\n",
      "were to do what was proper, good to friends and harm to enemies.' Every\n",
      "act does something to somebody; and following this analogy, Socrates\n",
      "asks, What is this due and proper thing which justice does, and to whom?\n",
      "He is answered that justice does good to friends and harm to enemies.\n",
      "But in what way good or harm? 'In making alliances with the one, and\n",
      "going to war with the other.' Then in time of peace what is the good\n",
      "of justice? The answer is that justice is of use in contracts, and\n",
      "contracts are money partnerships. Yes; but how in such partnerships\n",
      "is the just man of more use than any other man? 'When you want to have\n",
      "money safely kept and not used.' Then justice will be useful when money\n",
      "is useless. And there is another difficulty: justice, like the art of\n",
      "war or any other art, must be of opposites, good at attack as well as\n",
      "at defence, at stealing as well as at guarding. But then justice is a\n",
      "thief, though a hero notwithstanding, like Autolycus, the Homeric hero,\n",
      "who was 'excellent above all men in theft and perjury'--to such a pass\n",
      "have you and Homer and Simonides brought us; though I do not forget that\n",
      "the thieving must be for the good of friends and the harm of enemies.\n",
      "And still there arises another question: Are friends to be interpreted\n",
      "as real or seeming; enemies as real or seeming? And are our friends to\n",
      "be only the good, and our enemies to be the evil? The answer is, that\n",
      "we must do good to our seeming and real good friends, and evil to our\n",
      "seeming and real evil enemies--good to the good, evil to the evil. But\n",
      "ought we to render evil for evil at all, when to do so will only make\n",
      "men more evil? Can justice produce injustice any more than the art of\n",
      "horsemanship can make bad horsemen, or heat produce cold? The final\n",
      "conclusion is, that no sage or poet ever said that the just return\n",
      "evil for evil; this was a maxim of some rich and mighty man, Periander,\n",
      "Perdiccas, or Ismenias the Theban (about B.C. 398-381)...\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the first stage of aphoristic or unconscious morality is shown to\n",
      "be inadequate to the wants of the age; the authority of the poets is set\n",
      "aside, and through the winding mazes of dialectic we make an approach\n",
      "to the Christian precept of forgiveness of injuries. Similar words\n",
      "are applied by the Persian mystic poet to the Divine being when the\n",
      "questioning spirit is stirred within him:--'If because I do evil, Thou\n",
      "punishest me by evil, what is the difference between Thee and me?' In\n",
      "this both Plato and Kheyam rise above the level of many Christian (?)\n",
      "theologians. The first definition of justice easily passes into the\n",
      "second; for the simple words 'to speak the truth and pay your debts' is\n",
      "substituted the more abstract 'to do good to your friends and harm to\n",
      "your enemies.' Either of these explanations gives a sufficient rule\n",
      "of life for plain men, but they both fall short of the precision of\n",
      "philosophy. We may note in passing the antiquity of casuistry, which not\n",
      "only arises out of the conflict of established principles in particular\n",
      "cases, but also out of the effort to attain them, and is prior as well\n",
      "as posterior to our fundamental notions of morality. The 'interrogation'\n",
      "of moral ideas; the appeal to the authority of Homer; the conclusion\n",
      "that the maxim, 'Do good to your friends and harm to your enemies,'\n",

      "his adversary has changed his mind. In what follows Thrasymachus does\n",
      "in fact withdraw his admission that the ruler may make a mistake, for he\n",
      "affirms that the ruler as a ruler is infallible. Socrates is quite ready\n",

      "injustice was stronger than justice has not yet been refuted, and\n",
      "Socrates now proceeds to the consideration of this, which, with the\n",
      "assistance of Thrasymachus, he hopes to clear up; the latter is at first\n",

      "from art to morals. The next generation cleared up these perplexities;\n",
      "or at least supplied after ages with a further analysis of them. The\n",

      "indirect. He does not say that happiness consists in the contemplation\n",
      "of the idea of justice, and still less will he be tempted to affirm the\n",
      "Stoical paradox that the just man can be happy on the rack. But first he\n",
      "dwells on the difficulty of the problem and insists on restoring man to\n",
      "his natural condition, before he will answer the question at all. He\n",
      "too will frame an ideal, but his ideal comprehends not only abstract\n",
      "justice, but the whole relations of man. Under the fanciful illustration\n",
      "of the large letters he implies that he will only look for justice in\n",
      "society, and that from the State he will proceed to the individual. His\n",
      "answer in substance amounts to this,--that under favourable conditions,\n",
      "i.e. in the perfect State, justice and happiness will coincide, and that\n",
      "when justice has been once found, happiness may be left to take care\n",
      "of itself. That he falls into some degree of inconsistency, when in\n",
      "the tenth book he claims to have got rid of the rewards and honours\n",
      "of justice, may be admitted; for he has left those which exist in the\n",
      "perfect State. And the philosopher 'who retires under the shelter of a\n",
      "wall' can hardly have been esteemed happy by him, at least not in this\n",
      "world. Still he maintains the true attitude of moral action. Let a man\n",
      "do his duty first, without asking whether he will be happy or not, and\n",
      "happiness will be the inseparable accident which attends him. 'Seek ye\n",
      "first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things\n",
      "shall be added unto you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, it may be remarked that Plato preserves the genuine character\n",
      "of Greek thought in beginning with the State and in going on to the\n",
      "individual. First ethics, then politics--this is the order of ideas to\n",
      "us; the reverse is the order of history. Only after many struggles of\n",
      "thought does the individual assert his right as a moral being. In early\n",
      "ages he is not ONE, but one of many, the citizen of a State which is\n",
      "prior to him; and he has no notion of good or evil apart from the law\n",
      "of his country or the creed of his church. And to this type he is\n",
      "constantly tending to revert, whenever the influence of custom, or of\n",
      "party spirit, or the recollection of the past becomes too strong for\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, we may observe the confusion or identification of the\n",
      "individual and the State, of ethics and politics, which pervades early\n",
      "Greek speculation, and even in modern times retains a certain degree of\n",
      "influence. The subtle difference between the collective and individual\n",
      "action of mankind seems to have escaped early thinkers, and we too are\n",
      "sometimes in danger of forgetting the conditions of united human action,\n",
      "whenever we either elevate politics into ethics, or lower ethics to the\n",
      "standard of politics. The good man and the good citizen only coincide in\n",
      "the perfect State; and this perfection cannot be attained by legislation\n",

      "their character shows that they are uninfluenced by their own arguments.\n",

      "weak eyes he shall be allowed to read the large letters first and then\n",
      "go on to the smaller, that is, he must look for justice in the State\n",
      "first, and will then proceed to the individual. Accordingly he begins to\n",
      "construct the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Society arises out of the wants of man. His first want is food; his\n",
      "second a house; his third a coat. The sense of these needs and the\n",
      "possibility of satisfying them by exchange, draw individuals together on\n",
      "the same spot; and this is the beginning of a State, which we take the\n",
      "liberty to invent, although necessity is the real inventor. There must\n",
      "be first a husbandman, secondly a builder, thirdly a weaver, to which\n",
      "may be added a cobbler. Four or five citizens at least are required to\n",
      "make a city. Now men have different natures, and one man will do one\n",
      "thing better than many; and business waits for no man. Hence there must\n",
      "be a division of labour into different employments; into wholesale\n",
      "and retail trade; into workers, and makers of workmen's tools; into\n",
      "shepherds and husbandmen. A city which includes all this will have far\n",
      "exceeded the limit of four or five, and yet not be very large. But then\n",
      "again imports will be required, and imports necessitate exports,\n",
      "and this implies variety of produce in order to attract the taste of\n",
      "purchasers; also merchants and ships. In the city too we must have a\n",
      "market and money and retail trades; otherwise buyers and sellers will\n",
      "never meet, and the valuable time of the producers will be wasted in\n",
      "vain efforts at exchange. If we add hired servants the State will be\n",
      "complete. And we may guess that somewhere in the intercourse of the\n",
      "citizens with one another justice and injustice will appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here follows a rustic picture of their way of life. They spend their\n",
      "days in houses which they have built for themselves; they make their\n",
      "own clothes and produce their own corn and wine. Their principal food is\n",
      "meal and flour, and they drink in moderation. They live on the best\n",
      "of terms with each other, and take care not to have too many children.\n",
      "'But,' said Glaucon, interposing, 'are they not to have a relish?'\n",
      "Certainly; they will have salt and olives and cheese, vegetables and\n",
      "fruits, and chestnuts to roast at the fire. ''Tis a city of pigs,\n",
      "Socrates.' Why, I replied, what do you want more? 'Only the comforts of\n",
      "life,--sofas and tables, also sauces and sweets.' I see; you want not\n",
      "only a State, but a luxurious State; and possibly in the more complex\n",
      "frame we may sooner find justice and injustice. Then the fine arts must\n",
      "go to work--every conceivable instrument and ornament of luxury will be\n",
      "wanted. There will be dancers, painters, sculptors, musicians, cooks,\n",
      "barbers, tire-women, nurses, artists; swineherds and neatherds too for\n",
      "the animals, and physicians to cure the disorders of which luxury is the\n",
      "source. To feed all these superfluous mouths we shall need a part of\n",
      "our neighbour's land, and they will want a part of ours. And this is the\n",
      "origin of war, which may be traced to the same causes as other political\n",
      "evils. Our city will now require the slight addition of a camp, and\n",
      "the citizen will be converted into a soldier. But then again our old\n",
      "doctrine of the division of labour must not be forgotten. The art of\n",
      "war cannot be learned in a day, and there must be a natural aptitude\n",
      "for military duties. There will be some warlike natures who have this\n",
      "aptitude--dogs keen of scent, swift of foot to pursue, and strong of\n",
      "limb to fight. And as spirit is the foundation of courage, such natures,\n",
      "whether of men or animals, will be full of spirit. But these spirited\n",
      "natures are apt to bite and devour one another; the union of\n",
      "gentleness to friends and fierceness against enemies appears to be an\n",
      "impossibility, and the guardian of a State requires both qualities. Who\n",
      "then can be a guardian? The image of the dog suggests an answer. For\n",
      "dogs are gentle to friends and fierce to strangers. Your dog is a\n",
      "philosopher who judges by the rule of knowing or not knowing; and\n",
      "philosophy, whether in man or beast, is the parent of gentleness. The\n",
      "human watchdogs must be philosophers or lovers of learning which will\n",

      "\n",
      "But what shall their education be? Is any better than the old-fashioned\n",

      "life is very impressible, and children ought not to learn what they will\n",
      "have to unlearn when they grow up; we must therefore have a censorship\n",
      "of nursery tales, banishing some and keeping others. Some of them are\n",
      "very improper, as we may see in the great instances of Homer and Hesiod,\n",

      "flying for helping her when she was beaten? Such tales may possibly have\n",
      "a mystical interpretation, but the young are incapable of understanding\n",
      "allegory. If any one asks what tales are to be allowed, we will answer\n",
      "that we are legislators and not book-makers; we only lay down the\n",
      "principles according to which books are to be written; to write them is\n",
      "the duty of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "And our first principle is, that God must be represented as he is; not\n",
      "as the author of all things, but of good only. We will not suffer the\n",
      "poets to say that he is the steward of good and evil, or that he has two\n",
      "casks full of destinies;--or that Athene and Zeus incited Pandarus to\n",
      "break the treaty; or that God caused the sufferings of Niobe, or of\n",
      "Pelops, or the Trojan war; or that he makes men sin when he wishes to\n",
      "destroy them. Either these were not the actions of the gods, or God was\n",
      "just, and men were the better for being punished. But that the deed was\n",
      "evil, and God the author, is a wicked, suicidal fiction which we will\n",
      "allow no one, old or young, to utter. This is our first and great\n",
      "principle--God is the author of good only.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the second principle is like unto it:--With God is no variableness\n",
      "or change of form. Reason teaches us this; for if we suppose a change\n",
      "in God, he must be changed either by another or by himself. By\n",
      "another?--but the best works of nature and art and the noblest qualities\n",
      "of mind are least liable to be changed by any external force. By\n",
      "himself?--but he cannot change for the better; he will hardly change\n",
      "for the worse. He remains for ever fairest and best in his own image.\n",
      "Therefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell us of Here begging\n",
      "in the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl about at\n",
      "night in strange disguises; all that blasphemous nonsense with which\n",
      "mothers fool the manhood out of their children must be suppressed. But\n",
      "some one will say that God, who is himself unchangeable, may take a form\n",
      "in relation to us. Why should he? For gods as well as men hate the lie\n",
      "in the soul, or principle of falsehood; and as for any other form of\n",
      "lying which is used for a purpose and is regarded as innocent in certain\n",
      "exceptional cases--what need have the gods of this? For they are not\n",
      "ignorant of antiquity like the poets, nor are they afraid of their\n",
      "enemies, nor is any madman a friend of theirs. God then is true, he is\n",
      "absolutely true; he changes not, he deceives not, by day or night, by\n",
      "word or sign. This is our second great principle--God is true. Away\n",
      "with the lying dream of Agamemnon in Homer, and the accusation of Thetis\n",
      "against Apollo in Aeschylus...\n",

      "In order to give clearness to his conception of the State, Plato\n",
      "proceeds to trace the first principles of mutual need and of division\n",
      "of labour in an imaginary community of four or five citizens. Gradually\n",
      "this community increases; the division of labour extends to countries;\n",
      "imports necessitate exports; a medium of exchange is required, and\n",

      "These are the steps by which Plato constructs the first or primitive\n",
      "State, introducing the elements of political economy by the way. As\n",
      "he is going to frame a second or civilized State, the simple naturally\n",
      "comes before the complex. He indulges, like Rousseau, in a picture of\n",

      "not very different from saying that children must be taught through\n",
      "the medium of imagination as well as reason; that their minds can only\n",
      "develope gradually, and that there is much which they must learn without\n",
      "understanding. This is also the substance of Plato's view, though he\n",

      "comes first, afterwards the truth of the documents in which they are\n",
      "recorded, or of the events natural or supernatural which are told of\n",
      "them. But in modern times, and in Protestant countries perhaps more than\n",
      "in Catholic, we have been too much inclined to identify the historical\n",
      "with the moral; and some have refused to believe in religion at all,\n",
      "unless a superhuman accuracy was discernible in every part of the\n",

      "most important of all facts; but they are frequently uncertain, and we\n",

      "so great as might at first sight appear. For we should agree with him\n",

      "the souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats. The terrors and\n",
      "horrors of Cocytus and Styx, ghosts and sapless shades, and the rest\n",

      "In the next place our youth must be temperate, and temperance consists\n",

      "tells of the rapturous loves of Zeus and Here, or of how Hephaestus once\n",
      "detained Ares and Aphrodite in a net on a similar occasion. There is a\n",
      "nobler strain heard in the words:--'Endure, my soul, thou hast endured\n",
      "worse.' Nor must we allow our citizens to receive bribes, or to say,\n",

      "The subjects of poetry have been sufficiently treated; next follows\n",
      "style. Now all poetry is a narrative of events past, present, or to\n",

      "a composition of the two. An instance will make my meaning clear.\n",

      "Apollo that the Achaeans might take Troy and have a safe return if\n",
      "Agamemnon would only give him back his daughter; and the other Greeks\n",
      "assented, but Agamemnon was wroth, and so on--The whole then becomes\n",
      "descriptive, and the poet is the only speaker left; or, if you omit the\n",
      "narrative, the whole becomes dialogue. These are the three styles--which\n",
      "of them is to be admitted into our State? 'Do you ask whether tragedy\n",
      "and comedy are to be admitted?' Yes, but also something more--Is it not\n",
      "doubtful whether our guardians are to be imitators at all? Or rather,\n",
      "has not the question been already answered, for we have decided that one\n",
      "man cannot in his life play many parts, any more than he can act both\n",
      "tragedy and comedy, or be rhapsodist and actor at once? Human nature\n",
      "is coined into very small pieces, and as our guardians have their own\n",
      "business already, which is the care of freedom, they will have enough\n",
      "to do without imitating. If they imitate they should imitate, not any\n",
      "meanness or baseness, but the good only; for the mask which the actor\n",
      "wears is apt to become his face. We cannot allow men to play the parts\n",
      "of women, quarrelling, weeping, scolding, or boasting against the\n",
      "gods,--least of all when making love or in labour. They must not\n",
      "represent slaves, or bullies, or cowards, drunkards, or madmen, or\n",
      "blacksmiths, or neighing horses, or bellowing bulls, or sounding rivers,\n",
      "or a raging sea. A good or wise man will be willing to perform good and\n",
      "wise actions, but he will be ashamed to play an inferior part which he\n",
      "has never practised; and he will prefer to employ the descriptive style\n",
      "with as little imitation as possible. The man who has no self-respect,\n",
      "on the contrary, will imitate anybody and anything; sounds of nature\n",
      "and cries of animals alike; his whole performance will be imitation of\n",
      "gesture and voice. Now in the descriptive style there are few changes,\n",
      "but in the dramatic there are a great many. Poets and musicians use\n",
      "either, or a compound of both, and this compound is very attractive\n",
      "to youth and their teachers as well as to the vulgar. But our State in\n",
      "which one man plays one part only is not adapted for complexity. And\n",
      "when one of these polyphonous pantomimic gentlemen offers to exhibit\n",
      "himself and his poetry we will show him every observance of respect,\n",
      "but at the same time tell him that there is no room for his kind in our\n",
      "State; we prefer the rough, honest poet, and will not depart from our\n",
      "original models (Laws).\n",
      "\n",
      "Next as to the music. A song or ode has three parts,--the subject, the\n",
      "harmony, and the rhythm; of which the two last are dependent upon the\n",
      "first. As we banished strains of lamentation, so we may now banish the\n",
      "mixed Lydian harmonies, which are the harmonies of lamentation; and\n",
      "as our citizens are to be temperate, we may also banish convivial\n",
      "harmonies, such as the Ionian and pure Lydian. Two remain--the\n",
      "Dorian and Phrygian, the first for war, the second for peace; the\n",
      "one expressive of courage, the other of obedience or instruction or\n",
      "religious feeling. And as we reject varieties of harmony, we shall\n",
      "also reject the many-stringed, variously-shaped instruments which give\n",
      "utterance to them, and in particular the flute, which is more complex\n",
      "than any of them. The lyre and the harp may be permitted in the town,\n",
      "and the Pan's-pipe in the fields. Thus we have made a purgation of\n",
      "music, and will now make a purgation of metres. These should be like the\n",
      "harmonies, simple and suitable to the occasion. There are four notes\n",
      "of the tetrachord, and there are three ratios of metre, 3/2, 2/2,\n",
      "2/1, which have all their characteristics, and the feet have different\n",
      "characteristics as well as the rhythms. But about this you and I must\n",
      "ask Damon, the great musician, who speaks, if I remember rightly, of a\n",
      "martial measure as well as of dactylic, trochaic, and iambic rhythms,\n",
      "which he arranges so as to equalize the syllables with one another,\n",
      "assigning to each the proper quantity. We only venture to affirm the\n",
      "general principle that the style is to conform to the subject and the\n",
      "metre to the style; and that the simplicity and harmony of the soul\n",
      "should be reflected in them all. This principle of simplicity has to\n",
      "be learnt by every one in the days of his youth, and may be gathered\n",
      "anywhere, from the creative and constructive arts, as well as from the\n",
      "forms of plants and animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other artists as well as poets should be warned against meanness or\n",
      "unseemliness. Sculpture and painting equally with music must conform to\n",
      "the law of simplicity. He who violates it cannot be allowed to work in\n",
      "our city, and to corrupt the taste of our citizens. For our guardians\n",
      "must grow up, not amid images of deformity which will gradually poison\n",
      "and corrupt their souls, but in a land of health and beauty where they\n",
      "will drink in from every object sweet and harmonious influences. And of\n",
      "all these influences the greatest is the education given by music,\n",
      "which finds a way into the innermost soul and imparts to it the sense\n",
      "of beauty and of deformity. At first the effect is unconscious; but when\n",
      "reason arrives, then he who has been thus trained welcomes her as the\n",
      "friend whom he always knew. As in learning to read, first we acquire the\n",
      "elements or letters separately, and afterwards their combinations,\n",
      "and cannot recognize reflections of them until we know the letters\n",
      "themselves;--in like manner we must first attain the elements or\n",
      "essential forms of the virtues, and then trace their combinations in\n",
      "life and experience. There is a music of the soul which answers to the\n",
      "harmony of the world; and the fairest object of a musical soul is the\n",
      "fair mind in the fair body. Some defect in the latter may be excused,\n",
      "but not in the former. True love is the daughter of temperance, and\n",
      "temperance is utterly opposed to the madness of bodily pleasure. Enough\n",
      "has been said of music, which makes a fair ending with love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next we pass on to gymnastics; about which I would remark, that the\n",
      "soul is related to the body as a cause to an effect, and therefore if we\n",
      "educate the mind we may leave the education of the body in her charge,\n",
      "and need only give a general outline of the course to be pursued. In\n",
      "the first place the guardians must abstain from strong drink, for they\n",
      "should be the last persons to lose their wits. Whether the habits of\n",
      "the palaestra are suitable to them is more doubtful, for the ordinary\n",
      "gymnastic is a sleepy sort of thing, and if left off suddenly is apt to\n",
      "endanger health. But our warrior athletes must be wide-awake dogs, and\n",
      "must also be inured to all changes of food and climate. Hence they will\n",
      "require a simpler kind of gymnastic, akin to their simple music; and for\n",
      "their diet a rule may be found in Homer, who feeds his heroes on roast\n",
      "meat only, and gives them no fish although they are living at the\n",
      "sea-side, nor boiled meats which involve an apparatus of pots and pans;\n",
      "and, if I am not mistaken, he nowhere mentions sweet sauces. Sicilian\n",
      "cookery and Attic confections and Corinthian courtezans, which are\n",
      "to gymnastic what Lydian and Ionian melodies are to music, must be\n",
      "forbidden. Where gluttony and intemperance prevail the town quickly\n",
      "fills with doctors and pleaders; and law and medicine give themselves\n",
      "airs as soon as the freemen of a State take an interest in them. But\n",
      "what can show a more disgraceful state of education than to have to go\n",
      "abroad for justice because you have none of your own at home? And yet\n",
      "there IS a worse stage of the same disease--when men have learned\n",
      "to take a pleasure and pride in the twists and turns of the law; not\n",
      "considering how much better it would be for them so to order their lives\n",
      "as to have no need of a nodding justice. And there is a like disgrace in\n",
      "employing a physician, not for the cure of wounds or epidemic disorders,\n",
      "but because a man has by laziness and luxury contracted diseases\n",
      "which were unknown in the days of Asclepius. How simple is the Homeric\n",
      "practice of medicine. Eurypylus after he has been wounded drinks a\n",
      "posset of Pramnian wine, which is of a heating nature; and yet the\n",
      "sons of Asclepius blame neither the damsel who gives him the drink, nor\n",
      "Patroclus who is attending on him. The truth is that this modern system\n",
      "of nursing diseases was introduced by Herodicus the trainer; who,\n",
      "being of a sickly constitution, by a compound of training and medicine\n",
      "tortured first himself and then a good many other people, and lived\n",
      "a great deal longer than he had any right. But Asclepius would not\n",
      "practise this art, because he knew that the citizens of a well-ordered\n",
      "State have no leisure to be ill, and therefore he adopted the 'kill\n",
      "or cure' method, which artisans and labourers employ. 'They must be\n",
      "at their business,' they say, 'and have no time for coddling: if they\n",
      "recover, well; if they don't, there is an end of them.' Whereas the rich\n",
      "man is supposed to be a gentleman who can afford to be ill. Do you know\n",
      "a maxim of Phocylides--that 'when a man begins to be rich' (or, perhaps,\n",
      "a little sooner) 'he should practise virtue'? But how can excessive\n",
      "care of health be inconsistent with an ordinary occupation, and yet\n",
      "consistent with that practice of virtue which Phocylides inculcates?\n",
      "When a student imagines that philosophy gives him a headache, he never\n",
      "does anything; he is always unwell. This was the reason why Asclepius\n",
      "and his sons practised no such art. They were acting in the interest of\n",
      "the public, and did not wish to preserve useless lives, or raise up a\n",
      "puny offspring to wretched sires. Honest diseases they honestly cured;\n",
      "and if a man was wounded, they applied the proper remedies, and then let\n",
      "him eat and drink what he liked. But they declined to treat intemperate\n",
      "and worthless subjects, even though they might have made large fortunes\n",
      "out of them. As to the story of Pindar, that Asclepius was slain by a\n",
      "thunderbolt for restoring a rich man to life, that is a lie--following\n",
      "our old rule we must say either that he did not take bribes, or that he\n",
      "was not the son of a god.\n",

      "Glaucon then asks Socrates whether the best physicians and the best\n",
      "judges will not be those who have had severally the greatest experience\n",
      "of diseases and of crimes. Socrates draws a distinction between the two\n",
      "professions. The physician should have had experience of disease in\n",
      "his own body, for he cures with his mind and not with his body. But\n",
      "the judge controls mind by mind; and therefore his mind should not be\n",
      "corrupted by crime. Where then is he to gain experience? How is he to be\n",
      "wise and also innocent? When young a good man is apt to be deceived by\n",
      "evil-doers, because he has no pattern of evil in himself; and therefore\n",
      "the judge should be of a certain age; his youth should have been\n",
      "innocent, and he should have acquired insight into evil not by the\n",
      "practice of it, but by the observation of it in others. This is\n",
      "the ideal of a judge; the criminal turned detective is wonderfully\n",
      "suspicious, but when in company with good men who have experience, he is\n",
      "at fault, for he foolishly imagines that every one is as bad as himself.\n",
      "Vice may be known of virtue, but cannot know virtue. This is the sort of\n",
      "medicine and this the sort of law which will prevail in our State; they\n",
      "will be healing arts to better natures; but the evil body will be left\n",
      "to die by the one, and the evil soul will be put to death by the other.\n",
      "And the need of either will be greatly diminished by good music which\n",
      "will give harmony to the soul, and good gymnastic which will give\n",
      "health to the body. Not that this division of music and gymnastic really\n",
      "corresponds to soul and body; for they are both equally concerned with\n",
      "the soul, which is tamed by the one and aroused and sustained by the\n",
      "other. The two together supply our guardians with their twofold nature.\n",
      "The passionate disposition when it has too much gymnastic is hardened\n",
      "and brutalized, the gentle or philosophic temper which has too much\n",
      "music becomes enervated. While a man is allowing music to pour like\n",
      "water through the funnel of his ears, the edge of his soul gradually\n",
      "wears away, and the passionate or spirited element is melted out of\n",
      "him. Too little spirit is easily exhausted; too much quickly passes into\n",
      "nervous irritability. So, again, the athlete by feeding and training has\n",
      "his courage doubled, but he soon grows stupid; he is like a wild beast,\n",
      "ready to do everything by blows and nothing by counsel or policy. There\n",
      "are two principles in man, reason and passion, and to these, not to the\n",
      "soul and body, the two arts of music and gymnastic correspond. He who\n",

      "The religious and ethical aspect of Plato's education will hereafter\n",
      "be considered under a separate head. Some lesser points may be more\n",
      "conveniently noticed in this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The constant appeal to the authority of Homer, whom, with grave\n",
      "irony, Plato, after the manner of his age, summons as a witness about\n",
      "ethics and psychology, as well as about diet and medicine; attempting\n",
      "to distinguish the better lesson from the worse, sometimes altering\n",
      "the text from design; more than once quoting or alluding to Homer\n",
      "inaccurately, after the manner of the early logographers turning the\n",
      "Iliad into prose, and delighting to draw far-fetched inferences from\n",
      "his words, or to make ludicrous applications of them. He does not, like\n",
      "Heracleitus, get into a rage with Homer and Archilochus (Heracl.), but\n",
      "uses their words and expressions as vehicles of a higher truth; not on\n",
      "a system like Theagenes of Rhegium or Metrodorus, or in later times the\n",
      "Stoics, but as fancy may dictate. And the conclusions drawn from them\n",
      "are sound, although the premises are fictitious. These fanciful appeals\n",
      "to Homer add a charm to Plato's style, and at the same time they have\n",
      "the effect of a satire on the follies of Homeric interpretation. To us\n",
      "(and probably to himself), although they take the form of arguments,\n",
      "they are really figures of speech. They may be compared with modern\n",
      "citations from Scripture, which have often a great rhetorical power even\n",
      "when the original meaning of the words is entirely lost sight of. The\n",
      "real, like the Platonic Socrates, as we gather from the Memorabilia of\n",
      "Xenophon, was fond of making similar adaptations. Great in all ages and\n",
      "countries, in religion as well as in law and literature, has been the\n",
      "art of interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 'The style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style.'\n",
      "Notwithstanding the fascination which the word 'classical' exercises\n",
      "over us, we can hardly maintain that this rule is observed in all the\n",
      "Greek poetry which has come down to us. We cannot deny that the thought\n",
      "often exceeds the power of lucid expression in Aeschylus and Pindar;\n",
      "or that rhetoric gets the better of the thought in the Sophist-poet\n",
      "Euripides. Only perhaps in Sophocles is there a perfect harmony of the\n",
      "two; in him alone do we find a grace of language like the beauty of a\n",
      "Greek statue, in which there is nothing to add or to take away; at\n",
      "least this is true of single plays or of large portions of them. The\n",
      "connection in the Tragic Choruses and in the Greek lyric poets is not\n",
      "unfrequently a tangled thread which in an age before logic the poet was\n",
      "unable to draw out. Many thoughts and feelings mingled in his mind, and\n",
      "he had no power of disengaging or arranging them. For there is a subtle\n",
      "influence of logic which requires to be transferred from prose to\n",
      "poetry, just as the music and perfection of language are infused by\n",
      "poetry into prose. In all ages the poet has been a bad judge of his\n",
      "own meaning (Apol.); for he does not see that the word which is full\n",
      "of associations to his own mind is difficult and unmeaning to that of\n",
      "another; or that the sequence which is clear to himself is puzzling to\n",
      "others. There are many passages in some of our greatest modern poets\n",
      "which are far too obscure; in which there is no proportion between style\n",
      "and subject, in which any half-expressed figure, any harsh construction,\n",
      "any distorted collocation of words, any remote sequence of ideas is\n",
      "admitted; and there is no voice 'coming sweetly from nature,' or music\n",
      "adding the expression of feeling to thought. As if there could be poetry\n",
      "without beauty, or beauty without ease and clearness. The obscurities\n",
      "of early Greek poets arose necessarily out of the state of language and\n",
      "logic which existed in their age. They are not examples to be followed\n",
      "by us; for the use of language ought in every generation to become\n",
      "clearer and clearer. Like Shakespere, they were great in spite, not\n",
      "in consequence, of their imperfections of expression. But there is no\n",
      "reason for returning to the necessary obscurity which prevailed in\n",
      "the infancy of literature. The English poets of the last century were\n",
      "certainly not obscure; and we have no excuse for losing what they had\n",
      "gained, or for going back to the earlier or transitional age which\n",
      "preceded them. The thought of our own times has not out-stripped\n",
      "language; a want of Plato's 'art of measuring' is the rule cause of the\n",
      "disproportion between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In the third book of the Republic a nearer approach is made to a\n",
      "theory of art than anywhere else in Plato. His views may be summed up\n",
      "as follows:--True art is not fanciful and imitative, but simple and\n",
      "ideal,--the expression of the highest moral energy, whether in action or\n",
      "repose. To live among works of plastic art which are of this noble\n",
      "and simple character, or to listen to such strains, is the best of\n",
      "influences,--the true Greek atmosphere, in which youth should be brought\n",
      "up. That is the way to create in them a natural good taste, which will\n",
      "have a feeling of truth and beauty in all things. For though the\n",
      "poets are to be expelled, still art is recognized as another aspect of\n",
      "reason--like love in the Symposium, extending over the same sphere, but\n",
      "confined to the preliminary education, and acting through the power of\n",
      "habit; and this conception of art is not limited to strains of music or\n",
      "the forms of plastic art, but pervades all nature and has a wide kindred\n",
      "in the world. The Republic of Plato, like the Athens of Pericles, has an\n",
      "artistic as well as a political side.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is hardly any mention in Plato of the creative arts; only in two\n",
      "or three passages does he even allude to them (Rep.; Soph.). He is\n",
      "not lost in rapture at the great works of Phidias, the Parthenon, the\n",
      "Propylea, the statues of Zeus or Athene. He would probably have regarded\n",
      "any abstract truth of number or figure as higher than the greatest of\n",
      "them. Yet it is hard to suppose that some influence, such as he hopes to\n",
      "inspire in youth, did not pass into his own mind from the works of art\n",
      "which he saw around him. We are living upon the fragments of them, and\n",
      "find in a few broken stones the standard of truth and beauty. But in\n",
      "Plato this feeling has no expression; he nowhere says that beauty is the\n",
      "object of art; he seems to deny that wisdom can take an external form\n",
      "(Phaedrus); he does not distinguish the fine from the mechanical arts.\n",
      "Whether or no, like some writers, he felt more than he expressed, it\n",
      "is at any rate remarkable that the greatest perfection of the fine arts\n",
      "should coincide with an almost entire silence about them. In one very\n",
      "striking passage he tells us that a work of art, like the State, is a\n",
      "whole; and this conception of a whole and the love of the newly-born\n",
      "mathematical sciences may be regarded, if not as the inspiring, at any\n",
      "rate as the regulating principles of Greek art (Xen. Mem.; and Sophist).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Plato makes the true and subtle remark that the physician had better\n",
      "not be in robust health; and should have known what illness is in his\n",
      "own person. But the judge ought to have had no similar experience of\n",
      "evil; he is to be a good man who, having passed his youth in innocence,\n",
      "became acquainted late in life with the vices of others. And therefore,\n",
      "according to Plato, a judge should not be young, just as a young man\n",
      "according to Aristotle is not fit to be a hearer of moral philosophy.\n",
      "The bad, on the other hand, have a knowledge of vice, but no knowledge\n",
      "of virtue. It may be doubted, however, whether this train of reflection\n",
      "is well founded. In a remarkable passage of the Laws it is acknowledged\n",
      "that the evil may form a correct estimate of the good. The union of\n",
      "gentleness and courage in Book ii. at first seemed to be a paradox,\n",
      "yet was afterwards ascertained to be a truth. And Plato might also have\n",
      "found that the intuition of evil may be consistent with the abhorrence\n",
      "of it. There is a directness of aim in virtue which gives an insight\n",
      "into vice. And the knowledge of character is in some degree a natural\n",
      "sense independent of any special experience of good or evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. One of the most remarkable conceptions of Plato, because un-Greek and\n",
      "also very different from anything which existed at all in his age of\n",
      "the world, is the transposition of ranks. In the Spartan state there had\n",
      "been enfranchisement of Helots and degradation of citizens under\n",
      "special circumstances. And in the ancient Greek aristocracies, merit\n",
      "was certainly recognized as one of the elements on which government was\n",
      "based. The founders of states were supposed to be their benefactors, who\n",
      "were raised by their great actions above the ordinary level of humanity;\n",
      "at a later period, the services of warriors and legislators were held to\n",
      "entitle them and their descendants to the privileges of citizenship and\n",
      "to the first rank in the state. And although the existence of an ideal\n",
      "aristocracy is slenderly proven from the remains of early Greek history,\n",
      "and we have a difficulty in ascribing such a character, however the idea\n",
      "may be defined, to any actual Hellenic state--or indeed to any state\n",
      "which has ever existed in the world--still the rule of the best was\n",
      "certainly the aspiration of philosophers, who probably accommodated a\n",
      "good deal their views of primitive history to their own notions of good\n",

      "standard were either removed from the governing body, or not admitted\n",
      "to it; and this 'academic' discipline did to a certain extent prevail in\n",
      "Greek states, especially in Sparta. He also indicates that the system of\n",
      "caste, which existed in a great part of the ancient, and is by no means\n",
      "extinct in the modern European world, should be set aside from time\n",
      "to time in favour of merit. He is aware how deeply the greater part of\n",
      "mankind resent any interference with the order of society, and therefore\n",
      "he proposes his novel idea in the form of what he himself calls a\n",
      "'monstrous fiction.' (Compare the ceremony of preparation for the two\n",
      "'great waves' in Book v.) Two principles are indicated by him: first,\n",
      "that there is a distinction of ranks dependent on circumstances prior to\n",
      "the individual: second, that this distinction is and ought to be broken\n",
      "through by personal qualities. He adapts mythology like the Homeric\n",
      "poems to the wants of the state, making 'the Phoenician tale' the\n",
      "vehicle of his ideas. Every Greek state had a myth respecting its own\n",
      "origin; the Platonic republic may also have a tale of earthborn men. The\n",
      "gravity and verisimilitude with which the tale is told, and the analogy\n",
      "of Greek tradition, are a sufficient verification of the 'monstrous\n",
      "falsehood.' Ancient poetry had spoken of a gold and silver and brass and\n",
      "iron age succeeding one another, but Plato supposes these differences\n",
      "in the natures of men to exist together in a single state. Mythology\n",
      "supplies a figure under which the lesson may be taught (as Protagoras\n",
      "says, 'the myth is more interesting'), and also enables Plato to touch\n",
      "lightly on new principles without going into details. In this passage he\n",
      "shadows forth a general truth, but he does not tell us by what steps the\n",
      "transposition of ranks is to be effected. Indeed throughout the Republic\n",
      "he allows the lower ranks to fade into the distance. We do not know\n",
      "whether they are to carry arms, and whether in the fifth book they are\n",
      "or are not included in the communistic regulations respecting property\n",
      "and marriage. Nor is there any use in arguing strictly either from a\n",
      "few chance words, or from the silence of Plato, or in drawing inferences\n",
      "which were beyond his vision. Aristotle, in his criticism on the\n",
      "position of the lower classes, does not perceive that the poetical\n",
      "creation is 'like the air, invulnerable,' and cannot be penetrated by\n",
      "the shafts of his logic (Pol.).\n",

      "6. Two paradoxes which strike the modern reader as in the highest degree\n",
      "fanciful and ideal, and which suggest to him many reflections, are to\n",
      "be found in the third book of the Republic: first, the great power of\n",
      "music, so much beyond any influence which is experienced by us in modern\n",
      "times, when the art or science has been far more developed, and has\n",
      "found the secret of harmony, as well as of melody; secondly, the\n",
      "indefinite and almost absolute control which the soul is supposed to\n",
      "exercise over the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first we suspect some degree of exaggeration, such as we may\n",
      "also observe among certain masters of the art, not unknown to us, at the\n",
      "present day. With this natural enthusiasm, which is felt by a few only,\n",
      "there seems to mingle in Plato a sort of Pythagorean reverence for\n",
      "numbers and numerical proportion to which Aristotle is a stranger.\n",
      "Intervals of sound and number are to him sacred things which have a law\n",
      "of their own, not dependent on the variations of sense. They rise above\n",
      "sense, and become a connecting link with the world of ideas. But it is\n",
      "evident that Plato is describing what to him appears to be also a fact.\n",
      "The power of a simple and characteristic melody on the impressible\n",
      "mind of the Greek is more than we can easily appreciate. The effect of\n",
      "national airs may bear some comparison with it. And, besides all this,\n",
      "there is a confusion between the harmony of musical notes and the\n",
      "harmony of soul and body, which is so potently inspired by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second paradox leads up to some curious and interesting\n",
      "questions--How far can the mind control the body? Is the relation\n",
      "between them one of mutual antagonism or of mutual harmony? Are they\n",
      "two or one, and is either of them the cause of the other? May we not at\n",
      "times drop the opposition between them, and the mode of describing them,\n",
      "which is so familiar to us, and yet hardly conveys any precise meaning,\n",
      "and try to view this composite creature, man, in a more simple manner?\n",
      "Must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a higher\n",
      "and a lower principle, divided by no distinct line, which at times\n",
      "break asunder and take up arms against one another? Or again, they are\n",
      "reconciled and move together, either unconsciously in the ordinary work\n",
      "of life, or consciously in the pursuit of some noble aim, to be attained\n",
      "not without an effort, and for which every thought and nerve are\n",
      "strained. And then the body becomes the good friend or ally, or servant\n",
      "or instrument of the mind. And the mind has often a wonderful and almost\n",
      "superhuman power of banishing disease and weakness and calling out a\n",
      "hidden strength. Reason and the desires, the intellect and the senses\n",
      "are brought into harmony and obedience so as to form a single human\n",
      "being. They are ever parting, ever meeting; and the identity or\n",
      "diversity of their tendencies or operations is for the most part\n",
      "unnoticed by us. When the mind touches the body through the appetites,\n",
      "we acknowledge the responsibility of the one to the other. There is a\n",
      "tendency in us which says 'Drink.' There is another which says, 'Do\n",
      "not drink; it is not good for you.' And we all of us know which is the\n",
      "rightful superior. We are also responsible for our health, although into\n",
      "this sphere there enter some elements of necessity which may be beyond\n",
      "our control. Still even in the management of health, care and thought,\n",
      "continued over many years, may make us almost free agents, if we do\n",

      "the lords of the city, and yet instead of having, like other men, lands\n",
      "and houses and money of their own, they live as mercenaries and are\n",
      "always mounting guard.' You may add, I replied, that they receive no\n",
      "pay but only their food, and have no money to spend on a journey or a\n",
      "mistress. 'Well, and what answer do you give?' My answer is, that\n",
      "our guardians may or may not be the happiest of men,--I should not be\n",
      "surprised to find in the long-run that they were,--but this is not the\n",
      "aim of our constitution, which was designed for the good of the whole\n",
      "and not of any one part. If I went to a sculptor and blamed him for\n",
      "having painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not\n",
      "purple but black, he would reply: 'The eye must be an eye, and you\n",
      "should look at the statue as a whole.' 'Now I can well imagine a fool's\n",
      "paradise, in which everybody is eating and drinking, clothed in purple\n",

      "other classes of a State lose their distinctive character. And a State\n",
      "may get on without cobblers; but when the guardians degenerate into boon\n",
      "companions, then the ruin is complete. Remember that we are not talking\n",
      "of peasants keeping holiday, but of a State in which every man is\n",
      "expected to do his own work. The happiness resides not in this or that\n",
      "class, but in the State as a whole. I have another remark to make:--A\n",
      "middle condition is best for artisans; they should have money enough to\n",
      "buy tools, and not enough to be independent of business. And will not\n",
      "the same condition be best for our citizens? If they are poor, they will\n",
      "be mean; if rich, luxurious and lazy; and in neither case contented.\n",
      "'But then how will our poor city be able to go to war against an enemy\n",
      "who has money?' There may be a difficulty in fighting against one enemy;\n",
      "against two there will be none. In the first place, the contest will be\n",
      "carried on by trained warriors against well-to-do citizens: and is not a\n",
      "regular athlete an easy match for two stout opponents at least? Suppose\n",
      "also, that before engaging we send ambassadors to one of the two cities,\n",
      "saying, 'Silver and gold we have not; do you help us and take our share\n",
      "of the spoil;'--who would fight against the lean, wiry dogs, when they\n",

      "states join their resources, shall we not be in danger?' I am amused\n",
      "to hear you use the word 'state' of any but our own State. They are\n",
      "'states,' but not 'a state'--many in one. For in every state there are\n",
      "two hostile nations, rich and poor, which you may set one against the\n",

      "To the size of the state there is no limit but the necessity of unity;\n",
      "it must be neither too large nor too small to be one. This is a matter\n",
      "of secondary importance, like the principle of transposition which was\n",
      "intimated in the parable of the earthborn men. The meaning there implied\n",
      "was that every man should do that for which he was fitted, and be at\n",
      "one with himself, and then the whole city would be united. But all these\n",
      "things are secondary, if education, which is the great matter, be duly\n",

      "always increasing; and each generation improves upon the preceding, both\n",
      "in physical and moral qualities. The care of the governors should be\n",
      "directed to preserve music and gymnastic from innovation; alter the\n",
      "songs of a country, Damon says, and you will soon end by altering its\n",
      "laws. The change appears innocent at first, and begins in play; but\n",
      "the evil soon becomes serious, working secretly upon the characters of\n",
      "individuals, then upon social and commercial relations, and lastly upon\n",
      "the institutions of a state; and there is ruin and confusion everywhere.\n",
      "But if education remains in the established form, there will be no\n",
      "danger. A restorative process will be always going on; the spirit of law\n",
      "and order will raise up what has fallen down. Nor will any regulations\n",
      "be needed for the lesser matters of life--rules of deportment or\n",
      "fashions of dress. Like invites like for good or for evil. Education\n",
      "will correct deficiencies and supply the power of self-government. Far\n",

      "But without education they may patch and mend as they please; they will\n",
      "make no progress, any more than a patient who thinks to cure himself by\n",

      "If you tell such persons that they must first alter their habits, then\n",
      "they grow angry; they are charming people. 'Charming,--nay, the very\n",
      "reverse.' Evidently these gentlemen are not in your good graces, nor the\n",
      "state which is like them. And such states there are which first ordain\n",
      "under penalty of death that no one shall alter the constitution, and\n",
      "then suffer themselves to be flattered into and out of anything; and\n",
      "he who indulges them and fawns upon them, is their leader and saviour.\n",
      "'Yes, the men are as bad as the states.' But do you not admire their\n",
      "cleverness? 'Nay, some of them are stupid enough to believe what the\n",
      "people tell them.' And when all the world is telling a man that he is\n",
      "six feet high, and he has no measure, how can he believe anything\n",
      "else? But don't get into a passion: to see our statesmen trying their\n",
      "nostrums, and fancying that they can cut off at a blow the Hydra-like\n",
      "rogueries of mankind, is as good as a play. Minute enactments are\n",

      "Here, as Socrates would say, let us 'reflect on' (Greek) what has\n",
      "preceded: thus far we have spoken not of the happiness of the citizens,\n",
      "but only of the well-being of the State. They may be the happiest of\n",
      "men, but our principal aim in founding the State was not to make them\n",
      "happy. They were to be guardians, not holiday-makers. In this pleasant\n",
      "manner is presented to us the famous question both of ancient and modern\n",
      "philosophy, touching the relation of duty to happiness, of right to\n",
      "utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "First duty, then happiness, is the natural order of our moral ideas. The\n",
      "utilitarian principle is valuable as a corrective of error, and shows\n",
      "to us a side of ethics which is apt to be neglected. It may be admitted\n",
      "further that right and utility are co-extensive, and that he who makes\n",
      "the happiness of mankind his object has one of the highest and noblest\n",
      "motives of human action. But utility is not the historical basis of\n",
      "morality; nor the aspect in which moral and religious ideas commonly\n",
      "occur to the mind. The greatest happiness of all is, as we believe, the\n",
      "far-off result of the divine government of the universe. The greatest\n",
      "happiness of the individual is certainly to be found in a life of virtue\n",
      "and goodness. But we seem to be more assured of a law of right than we\n",
      "can be of a divine purpose, that 'all mankind should be saved;' and\n",
      "we infer the one from the other. And the greatest happiness of the\n",
      "individual may be the reverse of the greatest happiness in the ordinary\n",
      "sense of the term, and may be realised in a life of pain, or in a\n",
      "voluntary death. Further, the word 'happiness' has several ambiguities;\n",
      "it may mean either pleasure or an ideal life, happiness subjective or\n",
      "objective, in this world or in another, of ourselves only or of\n",
      "our neighbours and of all men everywhere. By the modern founder of\n",
      "Utilitarianism the self-regarding and disinterested motives of action\n",
      "are included under the same term, although they are commonly opposed\n",
      "by us as benevolence and self-love. The word happiness has not the\n",
      "definiteness or the sacredness of 'truth' and 'right'; it does\n",
      "not equally appeal to our higher nature, and has not sunk into the\n",
      "conscience of mankind. It is associated too much with the comforts and\n",
      "conveniences of life; too little with 'the goods of the soul which we\n",
      "desire for their own sake.' In a great trial, or danger, or temptation,\n",
      "or in any great and heroic action, it is scarcely thought of. For these\n",
      "reasons 'the greatest happiness' principle is not the true foundation of\n",
      "ethics. But though not the first principle, it is the second, which is\n",
      "like unto it, and is often of easier application. For the larger part of\n",
      "human actions are neither right nor wrong, except in so far as they tend\n",
      "to the happiness of mankind (Introd. to Gorgias and Philebus).\n",
      "\n",
      "The same question reappears in politics, where the useful or expedient\n",
      "seems to claim a larger sphere and to have a greater authority. For\n",
      "concerning political measures, we chiefly ask: How will they affect\n",
      "the happiness of mankind? Yet here too we may observe that what we term\n",
      "expediency is merely the law of right limited by the conditions of human\n",
      "society. Right and truth are the highest aims of government as well as\n",
      "of individuals; and we ought not to lose sight of them because we cannot\n",
      "directly enforce them. They appeal to the better mind of nations; and\n",
      "sometimes they are too much for merely temporal interests to resist.\n",
      "They are the watchwords which all men use in matters of public policy,\n",
      "as well as in their private dealings; the peace of Europe may be said\n",
      "to depend upon them. In the most commercial and utilitarian states\n",
      "of society the power of ideas remains. And all the higher class of\n",
      "statesmen have in them something of that idealism which Pericles is said\n",
      "to have gathered from the teaching of Anaxagoras. They recognise that\n",
      "the true leader of men must be above the motives of ambition, and\n",
      "that national character is of greater value than material comfort and\n",
      "prosperity. And this is the order of thought in Plato; first, he expects\n",
      "his citizens to do their duty, and then under favourable circumstances,\n",
      "that is to say, in a well-ordered State, their happiness is assured.\n",
      "That he was far from excluding the modern principle of utility in\n",
      "politics is sufficiently evident from other passages; in which 'the most\n",
      "beneficial is affirmed to be the most honourable', and also 'the most\n",
      "sacred'.\n",

      "three parts of the soul and one of the three classes in the State,\n",
      "although the third, temperance, has more of the nature of a harmony than\n",
      "the first two. If there be a fourth virtue, that can only be sought for\n",
      "in the relation of the three parts in the soul or classes in the State\n",
      "to one another. It is obvious and simple, and for that very reason has\n",
      "not been found out. The modern logician will be inclined to object that\n",
      "ideas cannot be separated like chemical substances, but that they run\n",
      "into one another and may be only different aspects or names of the\n",
      "same thing, and such in this instance appears to be the case. For the\n",
      "definition here given of justice is verbally the same as one of the\n",
      "definitions of temperance given by Socrates in the Charmides, which\n",
      "however is only provisional, and is afterwards rejected. And so far\n",
      "from justice remaining over when the other virtues are eliminated,\n",
      "the justice and temperance of the Republic can with difficulty be\n",
      "distinguished. Temperance appears to be the virtue of a part only, and\n",
      "one of three, whereas justice is a universal virtue of the whole soul.\n",
      "Yet on the other hand temperance is also described as a sort of harmony,\n",
      "and in this respect is akin to justice. Justice seems to differ from\n",
      "temperance in degree rather than in kind; whereas temperance is the\n",
      "harmony of discordant elements, justice is the perfect order by which\n",
      "all natures and classes do their own business, the right man in the\n",
      "right place, the division and co-operation of all the citizens. Justice,\n",
      "again, is a more abstract notion than the other virtues, and therefore,\n",
      "from Plato's point of view, the foundation of them, to which they\n",
      "are referred and which in idea precedes them. The proposal to omit\n",

      "are four cardinal virtues (now for the first time brought together in\n",
      "ethical philosophy), and one supreme over the rest, which is not like\n",
      "Aristotle's conception of universal justice, virtue relative to others,\n",
      "but the whole of virtue relative to the parts. To this universal\n",
      "conception of justice or order in the first education and in the moral\n",
      "nature of man, the still more universal conception of the good in the\n",
      "second education and in the sphere of speculative knowledge seems to\n",
      "succeed. Both might be equally described by the terms 'law,' 'order,'\n",

      "...Socrates is now going to identify the individual and the State. But\n",
      "first he must prove that there are three parts of the individual soul.\n",
      "His argument is as follows:--Quantity makes no difference in quality.\n",
      "The word 'just,' whether applied to the individual or to the State, has\n",
      "the same meaning. And the term 'justice' implied that the same three\n",
      "principles in the State and in the individual were doing their own\n",
      "business. But are they really three or one? The question is difficult,\n",
      "and one which can hardly be solved by the methods which we are now\n",
      "using; but the truer and longer way would take up too much of our time.\n",
      "'The shorter will satisfy me.' Well then, you would admit that the\n",
      "qualities of states mean the qualities of the individuals who compose\n",
      "them? The Scythians and Thracians are passionate, our own race\n",
      "intellectual, and the Egyptians and Phoenicians covetous, because\n",
      "the individual members of each have such and such a character; the\n",
      "difficulty is to determine whether the several principles are one or\n",
      "three; whether, that is to say, we reason with one part of our nature,\n",
      "desire with another, are angry with another, or whether the whole soul\n",
      "comes into play in each sort of action. This enquiry, however, requires\n",
      "a very exact definition of terms. The same thing in the same relation\n",
      "cannot be affected in two opposite ways. But there is no impossibility\n",
      "in a man standing still, yet moving his arms, or in a top which is fixed\n",
      "on one spot going round upon its axis. There is no necessity to mention\n",
      "all the possible exceptions; let us provisionally assume that opposites\n",
      "cannot do or be or suffer opposites in the same relation. And to the\n",
      "class of opposites belong assent and dissent, desire and avoidance.\n",
      "And one form of desire is thirst and hunger: and here arises a new\n",
      "point--thirst is thirst of drink, hunger is hunger of food; not of warm\n",
      "drink or of a particular kind of food, with the single exception of\n",
      "course that the very fact of our desiring anything implies that it is\n",
      "good. When relative terms have no attributes, their correlatives have\n",
      "no attributes; when they have attributes, their correlatives also have\n",
      "them. For example, the term 'greater' is simply relative to 'less,' and\n",
      "knowledge refers to a subject of knowledge. But on the other hand, a\n",
      "particular knowledge is of a particular subject. Again, every science\n",
      "has a distinct character, which is defined by an object; medicine, for\n",
      "example, is the science of health, although not to be confounded with\n",
      "health. Having cleared our ideas thus far, let us return to the original\n",
      "instance of thirst, which has a definite object--drink. Now the thirsty\n",
      "soul may feel two distinct impulses; the animal one saying 'Drink;'\n",
      "the rational one, which says 'Do not drink.' The two impulses are\n",
      "contradictory; and therefore we may assume that they spring from\n",
      "distinct principles in the soul. But is passion a third principle, or\n",
      "akin to desire? There is a story of a certain Leontius which throws some\n",
      "light on this question. He was coming up from the Piraeus outside the\n",
      "north wall, and he passed a spot where there were dead bodies lying\n",
      "by the executioner. He felt a longing desire to see them and also an\n",
      "abhorrence of them; at first he turned away and shut his eyes, then,\n",
      "suddenly tearing them open, he said,--'Take your fill, ye wretches, of\n",
      "the fair sight.' Now is there not here a third principle which is often\n",
      "found to come to the assistance of reason against desire, but never\n",
      "of desire against reason? This is passion or spirit, of the separate\n",
      "existence of which we may further convince ourselves by putting the\n",
      "following case:--When a man suffers justly, if he be of a generous\n",
      "nature he is not indignant at the hardships which he undergoes: but when\n",
      "he suffers unjustly, his indignation is his great support; hunger and\n",
      "thirst cannot tame him; the spirit within him must do or die, until the\n",
      "voice of the shepherd, that is, of reason, bidding his dog bark no\n",
      "more, is heard within. This shows that passion is the ally of reason. Is\n",
      "passion then the same with reason? No, for the former exists in children\n",
      "and brutes; and Homer affords a proof of the distinction between them\n",
      "when he says, 'He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, at last, we have reached firm ground, and are able to infer\n",
      "that the virtues of the State and of the individual are the same. For\n",
      "wisdom and courage and justice in the State are severally the wisdom and\n",
      "courage and justice in the individuals who form the State. Each of the\n",
      "three classes will do the work of its own class in the State, and each\n",
      "part in the individual soul; reason, the superior, and passion, the\n",
      "inferior, will be harmonized by the influence of music and gymnastic.\n",
      "The counsellor and the warrior, the head and the arm, will act together\n",
      "in the town of Mansoul, and keep the desires in proper subjection. The\n",
      "courage of the warrior is that quality which preserves a right opinion\n",
      "about dangers in spite of pleasures and pains. The wisdom of the\n",
      "counsellor is that small part of the soul which has authority and\n",
      "reason. The virtue of temperance is the friendship of the ruling and the\n",
      "subject principles, both in the State and in the individual. Of justice\n",
      "we have already spoken; and the notion already given of it may\n",
      "be confirmed by common instances. Will the just state or the just\n",
      "individual steal, lie, commit adultery, or be guilty of impiety to\n",
      "gods and men? 'No.' And is not the reason of this that the several\n",
      "principles, whether in the state or in the individual, do their own\n",
      "business? And justice is the quality which makes just men and just\n",
      "states. Moreover, our old division of labour, which required that there\n",
      "should be one man for one use, was a dream or anticipation of what was\n",
      "to follow; and that dream has now been realized in justice, which\n",
      "begins by binding together the three chords of the soul, and then acts\n",
      "harmoniously in every relation of life. And injustice, which is the\n",
      "insubordination and disobedience of the inferior elements in the soul,\n",
      "is the opposite of justice, and is inharmonious and unnatural, being to\n",
      "the soul what disease is to the body; for in the soul as well as in the\n",
      "body, good or bad actions produce good or bad habits. And virtue is the\n",
      "health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and vice is the disease\n",
      "and weakness and deformity of the soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the old question returns upon us: Is justice or injustice the\n",
      "more profitable? The question has become ridiculous. For injustice, like\n",
      "mortal disease, makes life not worth having. Come up with me to the hill\n",
      "which overhangs the city and look down upon the single form of virtue,\n",
      "and the infinite forms of vice, among which are four special ones,\n",
      "characteristic both of states and of individuals. And the state which\n",
      "corresponds to the single form of virtue is that which we have been\n",
      "describing, wherein reason rules under one of two names--monarchy and\n",
      "aristocracy. Thus there are five forms in all, both of states and of\n",
      "souls...\n",
      "\n",
      "In attempting to prove that the soul has three separate faculties, Plato\n",
      "takes occasion to discuss what makes difference of faculties. And\n",
      "the criterion which he proposes is difference in the working of the\n",
      "faculties. The same faculty cannot produce contradictory effects. But\n",
      "the path of early reasoners is beset by thorny entanglements, and he\n",
      "will not proceed a step without first clearing the ground. This leads\n",
      "him into a tiresome digression, which is intended to explain the nature\n",
      "of contradiction. First, the contradiction must be at the same time and\n",
      "in the same relation. Secondly, no extraneous word must be introduced\n",
      "into either of the terms in which the contradictory proposition is\n",
      "expressed: for example, thirst is of drink, not of warm drink. He\n",
      "implies, what he does not say, that if, by the advice of reason, or by\n",
      "the impulse of anger, a man is restrained from drinking, this proves\n",
      "that thirst, or desire under which thirst is included, is distinct\n",
      "from anger and reason. But suppose that we allow the term 'thirst' or\n",
      "'desire' to be modified, and say an 'angry thirst,' or a 'revengeful\n",
      "desire,' then the two spheres of desire and anger overlap and become\n",
      "confused. This case therefore has to be excluded. And still there\n",
      "remains an exception to the rule in the use of the term 'good,' which is\n",
      "always implied in the object of desire. These are the discussions of\n",
      "an age before logic; and any one who is wearied by them should remember\n",
      "that they are necessary to the clearing up of ideas in the first\n",
      "development of the human faculties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The psychology of Plato extends no further than the division of the soul\n",
      "into the rational, irascible, and concupiscent elements, which, as far\n",
      "as we know, was first made by him, and has been retained by Aristotle\n",
      "and succeeding ethical writers. The chief difficulty in this early\n",
      "analysis of the mind is to define exactly the place of the irascible\n",
      "faculty (Greek), which may be variously described under the terms\n",
      "righteous indignation, spirit, passion. It is the foundation of courage,\n",
      "which includes in Plato moral courage, the courage of enduring pain, and\n",
      "of surmounting intellectual difficulties, as well as of meeting dangers\n",
      "in war. Though irrational, it inclines to side with the rational: it\n",
      "cannot be aroused by punishment when justly inflicted: it sometimes\n",
      "takes the form of an enthusiasm which sustains a man in the performance\n",
      "of great actions. It is the 'lion heart' with which the reason makes\n",
      "a treaty. On the other hand it is negative rather than positive; it\n",
      "is indignant at wrong or falsehood, but does not, like Love in the\n",
      "Symposium and Phaedrus, aspire to the vision of Truth or Good. It is the\n",
      "peremptory military spirit which prevails in the government of honour.\n",
      "It differs from anger (Greek), this latter term having no accessory\n",
      "notion of righteous indignation. Although Aristotle has retained the\n",
      "word, yet we may observe that 'passion' (Greek) has with him lost its\n",
      "affinity to the rational and has become indistinguishable from 'anger'\n",
      "(Greek). And to this vernacular use Plato himself in the Laws seems to\n",
      "revert, though not always. By modern philosophy too, as well as in our\n",
      "ordinary conversation, the words anger or passion are employed almost\n",
      "exclusively in a bad sense; there is no connotation of a just or\n",
      "reasonable cause by which they are aroused. The feeling of 'righteous\n",
      "indignation' is too partial and accidental to admit of our regarding\n",
      "it as a separate virtue or habit. We are tempted also to doubt whether\n",
      "Plato is right in supposing that an offender, however justly condemned,\n",
      "could be expected to acknowledge the justice of his sentence; this is\n",
      "the spirit of a philosopher or martyr rather than of a criminal.\n",
      "\n",

      "that 'good actions produce good habits.' The words 'as healthy practices\n",
      "(Greek) produce health, so do just practices produce justice,' have\n",
      "a sound very like the Nicomachean Ethics. But we note also that an\n",

      "sixth and seventh books (compare Sophist and Parmenides) he has given\n",

      "of view, we can only conjecture. Perhaps he hoped to find some a priori\n",
      "method of developing the parts out of the whole; or he might have asked\n",
      "which of the ideas contains the other ideas, and possibly have stumbled\n",
      "on the Hegelian identity of the 'ego' and the 'universal.' Or he may\n",

      "experience. The aspirations of metaphysicians have always tended to\n",

      "something which is, as ignorance is of something which is not; and there\n",
      "is a third thing, which both is and is not, and is matter of opinion\n",

      "extremes, opinion must lie between them, and may be called darker than\n",
      "the one and brighter than the other. This intermediate or contingent\n",
      "matter is and is not at the same time, and partakes both of existence\n",
      "and of non-existence. Now I would ask my good friend, who denies\n",

      "little deaf, a little blind, and rather ignorant of the seaman's art.\n",
      "The sailors want to steer, although they know nothing of the art; and\n",
      "they have a theory that it cannot be learned. If the helm is refused\n",

      "they like it or not;--such an one would be called by them fool, prater,\n",
      "star-gazer. This is my parable; which I will beg you to interpret for\n",

      "to blame for his uselessness. The philosopher should not beg of mankind\n",
      "to be put in authority over them. The wise man should not seek the rich,\n",
      "as the proverb bids, but every man, whether rich or poor, must knock at\n",
      "the door of the physician when he has need of him. Now the pilot is\n",
      "the philosopher--he whom in the parable they call star-gazer, and the\n",
      "mutinous sailors are the mob of politicians by whom he is rendered\n",
      "useless. Not that these are the worst enemies of philosophy, who is far\n",
      "more dishonoured by her own professing sons when they are corrupted by\n",
      "the world. Need I recall the original image of the philosopher? Did we\n",
      "not say of him just now, that he loved truth and hated falsehood, and\n",
      "that he could not rest in the multiplicity of phenomena, but was led by\n",
      "a sympathy in his own nature to the contemplation of the absolute? All\n",
      "the virtues as well as truth, who is the leader of them, took up their\n",

      "of him, is a rare being. But what numberless causes tend to destroy\n",
      "these rare beings! There is no good thing which may not be a cause of\n",
      "evil--health, wealth, strength, rank, and the virtues themselves,\n",
      "when placed under unfavourable circumstances. For as in the animal or\n",
      "vegetable world the strongest seeds most need the accompaniment of good\n",
      "air and soil, so the best of human characters turn out the worst when\n",
      "they fall upon an unsuitable soil; whereas weak natures hardly ever\n",

      "either great criminals or great heroes are made. The philosopher follows\n",
      "the same analogy: he is either the best or the worst of all men. Some\n",

      "compulsion of exile or death. What principle of rival Sophists or\n",
      "anybody else can overcome in such an unequal contest? Characters there\n",
      "may be more than human, who are exceptions--God may save a man, but not\n",
      "his own strength. Further, I would have you consider that the hireling\n",
      "Sophist only gives back to the world their own opinions; he is the\n",
      "keeper of the monster, who knows how to flatter or anger him, and\n",
      "observes the meaning of his inarticulate grunts. Good is what pleases\n",
      "him, evil what he dislikes; truth and beauty are determined only by\n",
      "the taste of the brute. Such is the Sophist's wisdom, and such is the\n",
      "condition of those who make public opinion the test of truth, whether in\n",
      "art or in morals. The curse is laid upon them of being and doing what\n",
      "it approves, and when they attempt first principles the failure is\n",
      "ludicrous. Think of all this and ask yourself whether the world is more\n",
      "likely to be a believer in the unity of the idea, or in the multiplicity\n",
      "of phenomena. And the world if not a believer in the idea cannot be a\n",
      "philosopher, and must therefore be a persecutor of philosophers. There\n",
      "is another evil:--the world does not like to lose the gifted nature, and\n",
      "so they flatter the young (Alcibiades) into a magnificent opinion of his\n",
      "own capacity; the tall, proper youth begins to expand, and is dreaming\n",
      "of kingdoms and empires. If at this instant a friend whispers to\n",
      "him, 'Now the gods lighten thee; thou art a great fool' and must be\n",
      "educated--do you think that he will listen? Or suppose a better sort of\n",
      "man who is attracted towards philosophy, will they not make Herculean\n",
      "efforts to spoil and corrupt him? Are we not right in saying that the\n",
      "love of knowledge, no less than riches, may divert him? Men of this\n",
      "class (Critias) often become politicians--they are the authors of\n",
      "great mischief in states, and sometimes also of great good. And thus\n",
      "philosophy is deserted by her natural protectors, and others enter in\n",
      "and dishonour her. Vulgar little minds see the land open and rush from\n",
      "the prisons of the arts into her temple. A clever mechanic having a\n",
      "soul coarse as his body, thinks that he will gain caste by becoming her\n",
      "suitor. For philosophy, even in her fallen estate, has a dignity of her\n",
      "own--and he, like a bald little blacksmith's apprentice as he is, having\n",
      "made some money and got out of durance, washes and dresses himself as a\n",
      "bridegroom and marries his master's daughter. What will be the issue of\n",
      "such marriages? Will they not be vile and bastard, devoid of truth\n",
      "and nature? 'They will.' Small, then, is the remnant of genuine\n",
      "philosophers; there may be a few who are citizens of small states, in\n",
      "which politics are not worth thinking of, or who have been detained by\n",
      "Theages' bridle of ill health; for my own case of the oracular sign is\n",
      "almost unique, and too rare to be worth mentioning. And these few when\n",
      "they have tasted the pleasures of philosophy, and have taken a look at\n",
      "that den of thieves and place of wild beasts, which is human life,\n",
      "will stand aside from the storm under the shelter of a wall, and try to\n",
      "preserve their own innocence and to depart in peace. 'A great work, too,\n",
      "will have been accomplished by them.' Great, yes, but not the greatest;\n",
      "for man is a social being, and can only attain his highest development\n",
      "in the society which is best suited to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enough, then, of the causes why philosophy has such an evil name.\n",
      "Another question is, Which of existing states is suited to her? Not one\n",
      "of them; at present she is like some exotic seed which degenerates in\n",
      "a strange soil; only in her proper state will she be shown to be of\n",
      "heavenly growth. 'And is her proper state ours or some other?' Ours in\n",
      "all points but one, which was left undetermined. You may remember our\n",
      "saying that some living mind or witness of the legislator was needed in\n",
      "states. But we were afraid to enter upon a subject of such difficulty,\n",
      "and now the question recurs and has not grown easier:--How may\n",
      "philosophy be safely studied? Let us bring her into the light of day,\n",
      "and make an end of the inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, I say boldly that nothing can be worse than the\n",
      "present mode of study. Persons usually pick up a little philosophy in\n",
      "early youth, and in the intervals of business, but they never master the\n",
      "real difficulty, which is dialectic. Later, perhaps, they occasionally\n",
      "go to a lecture on philosophy. Years advance, and the sun of philosophy,\n",
      "unlike that of Heracleitus, sets never to rise again. This order of\n",
      "education should be reversed; it should begin with gymnastics in youth,\n",
      "and as the man strengthens, he should increase the gymnastics of\n",
      "his soul. Then, when active life is over, let him finally return to\n",
      "philosophy. 'You are in earnest, Socrates, but the world will be equally\n",
      "earnest in withstanding you--no more than Thrasymachus.' Do not make a\n",
      "quarrel between Thrasymachus and me, who were never enemies and are\n",
      "now good friends enough. And I shall do my best to convince him and\n",
      "all mankind of the truth of my words, or at any rate to prepare for\n",
      "the future when, in another life, we may again take part in similar\n",
      "discussions. 'That will be a long time hence.' Not long in comparison\n",
      "with eternity. The many will probably remain incredulous, for they\n",
      "have never seen the natural unity of ideas, but only artificial\n",
      "juxtapositions; not free and generous thoughts, but tricks of\n",
      "controversy and quips of law;--a perfect man ruling in a perfect state,\n",
      "even a single one they have not known. And we foresaw that there was no\n",
      "chance of perfection either in states or individuals until a necessity\n",
      "was laid upon philosophers--not the rogues, but those whom we called\n",
      "the useless class--of holding office; or until the sons of kings were\n",
      "inspired with a true love of philosophy. Whether in the infinity of\n",
      "past time there has been, or is in some distant land, or ever will be\n",
      "hereafter, an ideal such as we have described, we stoutly maintain\n",
      "that there has been, is, and will be such a state whenever the Muse of\n",
      "philosophy rules. Will you say that the world is of another mind? O, my\n",
      "friend, do not revile the world! They will soon change their opinion\n",
      "if they are gently entreated, and are taught the true nature of the\n",
      "philosopher. Who can hate a man who loves him? Or be jealous of one who\n",
      "has no jealousy? Consider, again, that the many hate not the true but\n",
      "the false philosophers--the pretenders who force their way in without\n",
      "invitation, and are always speaking of persons and not of principles,\n",
      "which is unlike the spirit of philosophy. For the true philosopher\n",
      "despises earthly strife; his eye is fixed on the eternal order in\n",
      "accordance with which he moulds himself into the Divine image (and not\n",
      "himself only, but other men), and is the creator of the virtues private\n",
      "as well as public. When mankind see that the happiness of states is only\n",
      "to be found in that image, will they be angry with us for attempting\n",
      "to delineate it? 'Certainly not. But what will be the process of\n",
      "delineation?' The artist will do nothing until he has made a tabula\n",
      "rasa; on this he will inscribe the constitution of a state, glancing\n",
      "often at the divine truth of nature, and from that deriving the godlike\n",
      "among men, mingling the two elements, rubbing out and painting in,\n",
      "until there is a perfect harmony or fusion of the divine and human. But\n",
      "perhaps the world will doubt the existence of such an artist. What will\n",
      "they doubt? That the philosopher is a lover of truth, having a nature\n",
      "akin to the best?--and if they admit this will they still quarrel with\n",
      "us for making philosophers our kings? 'They will be less disposed to\n",
      "quarrel.' Let us assume then that they are pacified. Still, a person may\n",
      "hesitate about the probability of the son of a king being a philosopher.\n",
      "And we do not deny that they are very liable to be corrupted; but yet\n",
      "surely in the course of ages there might be one exception--and one\n",
      "is enough. If one son of a king were a philosopher, and had obedient\n",
      "citizens, he might bring the ideal polity into being. Hence we conclude\n",
      "that our laws are not only the best, but that they are also possible,\n",
      "though not free from difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I gained nothing by evading the troublesome questions which arose\n",
      "concerning women and children. I will be wiser now and acknowledge\n",
      "that we must go to the bottom of another question: What is to be the\n",
      "education of our guardians? It was agreed that they were to be lovers of\n",
      "their country, and were to be tested in the refiner's fire of pleasures\n",
      "and pains, and those who came forth pure and remained fixed in their\n",
      "principles were to have honours and rewards in life and after death.\n",
      "But at this point, the argument put on her veil and turned into another\n",
      "path. I hesitated to make the assertion which I now hazard,--that our\n",
      "guardians must be philosophers. You remember all the contradictory\n",
      "elements, which met in the philosopher--how difficult to find them all\n",
      "in a single person! Intelligence and spirit are not often combined with\n",
      "steadiness; the stolid, fearless, nature is averse to intellectual toil.\n",
      "And yet these opposite elements are all necessary, and therefore, as\n",
      "we were saying before, the aspirant must be tested in pleasures and\n",
      "dangers; and also, as we must now further add, in the highest branches\n",
      "of knowledge. You will remember, that when we spoke of the virtues\n",
      "mention was made of a longer road, which you were satisfied to leave\n",
      "unexplored. 'Enough seemed to have been said.' Enough, my friend; but\n",
      "what is enough while anything remains wanting? Of all men the guardian\n",
      "must not faint in the search after truth; he must be prepared to take\n",
      "the longer road, or he will never reach that higher region which is\n",
      "above the four virtues; and of the virtues too he must not only get an\n",
      "outline, but a clear and distinct vision. (Strange that we should be so\n",
      "precise about trifles, so careless about the highest truths!) 'And what\n",
      "are the highest?' You to pretend unconsciousness, when you have so often\n",
      "heard me speak of the idea of good, about which we know so little, and\n",
      "without which though a man gain the world he has no profit of it! Some\n",
      "people imagine that the good is wisdom; but this involves a circle,--the\n",
      "good, they say, is wisdom, wisdom has to do with the good. According to\n",
      "others the good is pleasure; but then comes the absurdity that good is\n",
      "bad, for there are bad pleasures as well as good. Again, the good must\n",
      "have reality; a man may desire the appearance of virtue, but he will not\n",
      "desire the appearance of good. Ought our guardians then to be ignorant\n",
      "of this supreme principle, of which every man has a presentiment, and\n",
      "without which no man has any real knowledge of anything? 'But, Socrates,\n",
      "what is this supreme principle, knowledge or pleasure, or what? You may\n",
      "think me troublesome, but I say that you have no business to be always\n",
      "repeating the doctrines of others instead of giving us your own.' Can\n",
      "I say what I do not know? 'You may offer an opinion.' And will the\n",
      "blindness and crookedness of opinion content you when you might have\n",
      "the light and certainty of science? 'I will only ask you to give such\n",
      "an explanation of the good as you have given already of temperance and\n",
      "justice.' I wish that I could, but in my present mood I cannot reach to\n",
      "the height of the knowledge of the good. To the parent or principal I\n",
      "cannot introduce you, but to the child begotten in his image, which\n",
      "I may compare with the interest on the principal, I will. (Audit the\n",
      "account, and do not let me give you a false statement of the debt.)\n",
      "You remember our old distinction of the many beautiful and the one\n",
      "beautiful, the particular and the universal, the objects of sight and\n",
      "the objects of thought? Did you ever consider that the objects of sight\n",
      "imply a faculty of sight which is the most complex and costly of our\n",
      "senses, requiring not only objects of sense, but also a medium, which is\n",
      "light; without which the sight will not distinguish between colours and\n",
      "all will be a blank? For light is the noble bond between the perceiving\n",
      "faculty and the thing perceived, and the god who gives us light is the\n",
      "sun, who is the eye of the day, but is not to be confounded with the eye\n",
      "of man. This eye of the day or sun is what I call the child of the good,\n",
      "standing in the same relation to the visible world as the good to the\n",
      "intellectual. When the sun shines the eye sees, and in the intellectual\n",
      "world where truth is, there is sight and light. Now that which is the\n",
      "sun of intelligent natures, is the idea of good, the cause of knowledge\n",
      "and truth, yet other and fairer than they are, and standing in the\n",
      "same relation to them in which the sun stands to light. O inconceivable\n",
      "height of beauty, which is above knowledge and above truth! ('You cannot\n",
      "surely mean pleasure,' he said. Peace, I replied.) And this idea of\n",
      "good, like the sun, is also the cause of growth, and the author not of\n",
      "knowledge only, but of being, yet greater far than either in dignity\n",
      "and power. 'That is a reach of thought more than human; but, pray, go\n",
      "on with the image, for I suspect that there is more behind.' There is,\n",
      "I said; and bearing in mind our two suns or principles, imagine further\n",
      "their corresponding worlds--one of the visible, the other of the\n",
      "intelligible; you may assist your fancy by figuring the distinction\n",
      "under the image of a line divided into two unequal parts, and may again\n",
      "subdivide each part into two lesser segments representative of the\n",
      "stages of knowledge in either sphere. The lower portion of the lower or\n",
      "visible sphere will consist of shadows and reflections, and its upper\n",
      "and smaller portion will contain real objects in the world of nature\n",
      "or of art. The sphere of the intelligible will also have two\n",
      "divisions,--one of mathematics, in which there is no ascent but all is\n",
      "descent; no inquiring into premises, but only drawing of inferences.\n",
      "In this division the mind works with figures and numbers, the images of\n",
      "which are taken not from the shadows, but from the objects, although\n",
      "the truth of them is seen only with the mind's eye; and they are used as\n",
      "hypotheses without being analysed. Whereas in the other division reason\n",
      "uses the hypotheses as stages or steps in the ascent to the idea of\n",
      "good, to which she fastens them, and then again descends, walking firmly\n",
      "in the region of ideas, and of ideas only, in her ascent as well as\n",
      "descent, and finally resting in them. 'I partly understand,' he replied;\n",
      "'you mean that the ideas of science are superior to the hypothetical,\n",
      "metaphorical conceptions of geometry and the other arts or sciences,\n",
      "whichever is to be the name of them; and the latter conceptions you\n",
      "refuse to make subjects of pure intellect, because they have no first\n",
      "principle, although when resting on a first principle, they pass into\n",
      "the higher sphere.' You understand me very well, I said. And now to\n",
      "those four divisions of knowledge you may assign four corresponding\n",
      "faculties--pure intelligence to the highest sphere; active intelligence\n",
      "to the second; to the third, faith; to the fourth, the perception of\n",

      "In language which seems to reach beyond the horizon of that age\n",
      "and country, he is described as 'the spectator of all time and all\n",
      "existence.' He has the noblest gifts of nature, and makes the highest\n",
      "use of them. All his desires are absorbed in the love of wisdom, which\n",
      "is the love of truth. None of the graces of a beautiful soul are wanting\n",
      "in him; neither can he fear death, or think much of human life. The\n",
      "ideal of modern times hardly retains the simplicity of the antique;\n",
      "there is not the same originality either in truth or error which\n",
      "characterized the Greeks. The philosopher is no longer living in the\n",
      "unseen, nor is he sent by an oracle to convince mankind of ignorance;\n",
      "nor does he regard knowledge as a system of ideas leading upwards by\n",
      "regular stages to the idea of good. The eagerness of the pursuit has\n",
      "abated; there is more division of labour and less of comprehensive\n",
      "reflection upon nature and human life as a whole; more of exact\n",
      "observation and less of anticipation and inspiration. Still, in the\n",
      "altered conditions of knowledge, the parallel is not wholly lost; and\n",
      "there may be a use in translating the conception of Plato into the\n",
      "language of our own age. The philosopher in modern times is one who\n",
      "fixes his mind on the laws of nature in their sequence and connexion,\n",
      "not on fragments or pictures of nature; on history, not on controversy;\n",
      "on the truths which are acknowledged by the few, not on the opinions\n",
      "of the many. He is aware of the importance of 'classifying according to\n",
      "nature,' and will try to 'separate the limbs of science without breaking\n",
      "them' (Phaedr.). There is no part of truth, whether great or small,\n",
      "which he will dishonour; and in the least things he will discern the\n",
      "greatest (Parmen.). Like the ancient philosopher he sees the world\n",
      "pervaded by analogies, but he can also tell 'why in some cases a single\n",
      "instance is sufficient for an induction' (Mill's Logic), while in\n",
      "other cases a thousand examples would prove nothing. He inquires into\n",
      "a portion of knowledge only, because the whole has grown too vast to be\n",
      "embraced by a single mind or life. He has a clearer conception of the\n",
      "divisions of science and of their relation to the mind of man than was\n",
      "possible to the ancients. Like Plato, he has a vision of the unity of\n",
      "knowledge, not as the beginning of philosophy to be attained by a study\n",
      "of elementary mathematics, but as the far-off result of the working\n",
      "of many minds in many ages. He is aware that mathematical studies are\n",
      "preliminary to almost every other; at the same time, he will not reduce\n",
      "all varieties of knowledge to the type of mathematics. He too must have\n",
      "a nobility of character, without which genius loses the better half\n",
      "of greatness. Regarding the world as a point in immensity, and each\n",
      "individual as a link in a never-ending chain of existence, he will not\n",
      "think much of his own life, or be greatly afraid of death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adeimantus objects first of all to the form of the Socratic reasoning,\n",
      "thus showing that Plato is aware of the imperfection of his own method.\n",
      "He brings the accusation against himself which might be brought against\n",
      "him by a modern logician--that he extracts the answer because he knows\n",
      "how to put the question. In a long argument words are apt to change\n",
      "their meaning slightly, or premises may be assumed or conclusions\n",
      "inferred with rather too much certainty or universality; the variation\n",
      "at each step may be unobserved, and yet at last the divergence becomes\n",
      "considerable. Hence the failure of attempts to apply arithmetical or\n",
      "algebraic formulae to logic. The imperfection, or rather the higher\n",
      "and more elastic nature of language, does not allow words to have the\n",
      "precision of numbers or of symbols. And this quality in language impairs\n",
      "the force of an argument which has many steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The objection, though fairly met by Socrates in this particular\n",
      "instance, may be regarded as implying a reflection upon the Socratic\n",
      "mode of reasoning. And here, as elsewhere, Plato seems to intimate that\n",
      "the time had come when the negative and interrogative method of Socrates\n",
      "must be superseded by a positive and constructive one, of which examples\n",
      "are given in some of the later dialogues. Adeimantus further argues\n",
      "that the ideal is wholly at variance with facts; for experience proves\n",
      "philosophers to be either useless or rogues. Contrary to all expectation\n",
      "Socrates has no hesitation in admitting the truth of this, and explains\n",
      "the anomaly in an allegory, first characteristically depreciating his\n",
      "own inventive powers. In this allegory the people are distinguished from\n",
      "the professional politicians, and, as elsewhere, are spoken of in a tone\n",
      "of pity rather than of censure under the image of 'the noble captain who\n",
      "is not very quick in his perceptions.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The uselessness of philosophers is explained by the circumstance that\n",
      "mankind will not use them. The world in all ages has been divided\n",
      "between contempt and fear of those who employ the power of ideas and\n",
      "know no other weapons. Concerning the false philosopher, Socrates argues\n",
      "that the best is most liable to corruption; and that the finer nature is\n",
      "more likely to suffer from alien conditions. We too observe that there\n",
      "are some kinds of excellence which spring from a peculiar delicacy\n",
      "of constitution; as is evidently true of the poetical and imaginative\n",
      "temperament, which often seems to depend on impressions, and hence can\n",
      "only breathe or live in a certain atmosphere. The man of genius\n",
      "has greater pains and greater pleasures, greater powers and greater\n",
      "weaknesses, and often a greater play of character than is to be found in\n",
      "ordinary men. He can assume the disguise of virtue or disinterestedness\n",
      "without having them, or veil personal enmity in the language of\n",
      "patriotism and philosophy,--he can say the word which all men are\n",
      "thinking, he has an insight which is terrible into the follies and\n",
      "weaknesses of his fellow-men. An Alcibiades, a Mirabeau, or a Napoleon\n",
      "the First, are born either to be the authors of great evils in states,\n",
      "or 'of great good, when they are drawn in that direction.'\n",

      "Yet the thesis, 'corruptio optimi pessima,' cannot be maintained\n",
      "generally or without regard to the kind of excellence which is\n",
      "corrupted. The alien conditions which are corrupting to one nature, may\n",
      "be the elements of culture to another. In general a man can only receive\n",
      "his highest development in a congenial state or family, among friends\n",
      "or fellow-workers. But also he may sometimes be stirred by adverse\n",
      "circumstances to such a degree that he rises up against them and reforms\n",
      "them. And while weaker or coarser characters will extract good out of\n",
      "evil, say in a corrupt state of the church or of society, and live on\n",
      "happily, allowing the evil to remain, the finer or stronger natures may\n",
      "be crushed or spoiled by surrounding influences--may become misanthrope\n",
      "and philanthrope by turns; or in a few instances, like the founders\n",
      "of the monastic orders, or the Reformers, owing to some peculiarity in\n",
      "themselves or in their age, may break away entirely from the world and\n",
      "from the church, sometimes into great good, sometimes into great evil,\n",

      "2nd, the heavenly pattern or idea of the state; 3rd, the relation of the\n",

      "of the soul:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Of the higher method of knowledge in Plato we have only a glimpse.\n",
      "Neither here nor in the Phaedrus or Symposium, nor yet in the Philebus\n",
      "or Sophist, does he give any clear explanation of his meaning. He would\n",
      "probably have described his method as proceeding by regular steps to a\n",
      "system of universal knowledge, which inferred the parts from the whole\n",
      "rather than the whole from the parts. This ideal logic is not practised\n",
      "by him in the search after justice, or in the analysis of the parts of\n",
      "the soul; there, like Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics, he argues\n",
      "from experience and the common use of language. But at the end of the\n",
      "sixth book he conceives another and more perfect method, in which\n",
      "all ideas are only steps or grades or moments of thought, forming a\n",
      "connected whole which is self-supporting, and in which consistency is\n",
      "the test of truth. He does not explain to us in detail the nature of the\n",
      "process. Like many other thinkers both in ancient and modern times\n",
      "his mind seems to be filled with a vacant form which he is unable to\n",
      "realize. He supposes the sciences to have a natural order and connexion\n",
      "in an age when they can hardly be said to exist. He is hastening on to\n",
      "the 'end of the intellectual world' without even making a beginning of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In modern times we hardly need to be reminded that the process of\n",
      "acquiring knowledge is here confused with the contemplation of absolute\n",
      "knowledge. In all science a priori and a posteriori truths mingle in\n",
      "various proportions. The a priori part is that which is derived from the\n",
      "most universal experience of men, or is universally accepted by\n",
      "them; the a posteriori is that which grows up around the more\n",
      "general principles and becomes imperceptibly one with them. But Plato\n",
      "erroneously imagines that the synthesis is separable from the analysis,\n",
      "and that the method of science can anticipate science. In entertaining\n",
      "such a vision of a priori knowledge he is sufficiently justified, or at\n",
      "least his meaning may be sufficiently explained by the similar attempts\n",
      "of Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and even of Bacon himself, in modern\n",
      "philosophy. Anticipations or divinations, or prophetic glimpses of\n",
      "truths whether concerning man or nature, seem to stand in the same\n",
      "relation to ancient philosophy which hypotheses bear to modern inductive\n",
      "science. These 'guesses at truth' were not made at random; they arose\n",
      "from a superficial impression of uniformities and first principles\n",
      "in nature which the genius of the Greek, contemplating the expanse of\n",
      "heaven and earth, seemed to recognize in the distance. Nor can we deny\n",
      "that in ancient times knowledge must have stood still, and the human\n",
      "mind been deprived of the very instruments of thought, if philosophy had\n",
      "been strictly confined to the results of experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Plato supposes that when the tablet has been made blank the artist\n",
      "will fill in the lineaments of the ideal state. Is this a pattern laid\n",
      "up in heaven, or mere vacancy on which he is supposed to gaze with\n",
      "wondering eye? The answer is, that such ideals are framed partly by the\n",
      "omission of particulars, partly by imagination perfecting the form which\n",
      "experience supplies (Phaedo). Plato represents these ideals in a\n",
      "figure as belonging to another world; and in modern times the idea will\n",
      "sometimes seem to precede, at other times to co-operate with the hand\n",
      "of the artist. As in science, so also in creative art, there is a\n",
      "synthetical as well as an analytical method. One man will have the whole\n",
      "in his mind before he begins; to another the processes of mind and hand\n",
      "will be simultaneous.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. There is no difficulty in seeing that Plato's divisions of knowledge\n",
      "are based, first, on the fundamental antithesis of sensible and\n",
      "intellectual which pervades the whole pre-Socratic philosophy; in which\n",
      "is implied also the opposition of the permanent and transient, of the\n",
      "universal and particular. But the age of philosophy in which he lived\n",
      "seemed to require a further distinction;--numbers and figures were\n",
      "beginning to separate from ideas. The world could no longer regard\n",
      "justice as a cube, and was learning to see, though imperfectly, that\n",
      "the abstractions of sense were distinct from the abstractions of mind.\n",
      "Between the Eleatic being or essence and the shadows of phenomena, the\n",
      "Pythagorean principle of number found a place, and was, as Aristotle\n",
      "remarks, a conducting medium from one to the other. Hence Plato is led\n",
      "to introduce a third term which had not hitherto entered into the scheme\n",
      "of his philosophy. He had observed the use of mathematics in education;\n",
      "they were the best preparation for higher studies. The subjective\n",
      "relation between them further suggested an objective one; although\n",
      "the passage from one to the other is really imaginary (Metaph.). For\n",
      "metaphysical and moral philosophy has no connexion with mathematics;\n",
      "number and figure are the abstractions of time and space, not the\n",
      "expressions of purely intellectual conceptions. When divested of\n",
      "metaphor, a straight line or a square has no more to do with right and\n",
      "justice than a crooked line with vice. The figurative association was\n",
      "mistaken for a real one; and thus the three latter divisions of the\n",
      "Platonic proportion were constructed.\n",

      "There is more difficulty in comprehending how he arrived at the\n",
      "first term of the series, which is nowhere else mentioned, and has no\n",
      "reference to any other part of his system. Nor indeed does the relation\n",
      "of shadows to objects correspond to the relation of numbers to ideas.\n",
      "Probably Plato has been led by the love of analogy (Timaeus) to make\n",
      "four terms instead of three, although the objects perceived in both\n",
      "divisions of the lower sphere are equally objects of sense. He is also\n",
      "preparing the way, as his manner is, for the shadows of images at the\n",
      "beginning of the seventh book, and the imitation of an imitation in the\n",
      "tenth. The line may be regarded as reaching from unity to infinity, and\n",
      "is divided into two unequal parts, and subdivided into two more;\n",
      "each lower sphere is the multiplication of the preceding. Of the four\n",
      "faculties, faith in the lower division has an intermediate position (cp.\n",
      "for the use of the word faith or belief, (Greek), Timaeus), contrasting\n",
      "equally with the vagueness of the perception of shadows (Greek) and the\n",
      "higher certainty of understanding (Greek) and reason (Greek).\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference between understanding and mind or reason (Greek) is\n",
      "analogous to the difference between acquiring knowledge in the parts\n",
      "and the contemplation of the whole. True knowledge is a whole, and is\n",
      "at rest; consistency and universality are the tests of truth. To this\n",
      "self-evidencing knowledge of the whole the faculty of mind is supposed\n",
      "to correspond. But there is a knowledge of the understanding which\n",

      "underground den which is open towards the light; they have been there\n",
      "from childhood, having their necks and legs chained, and can only see\n",
      "into the den. At a distance there is a fire, and between the fire and\n",
      "the prisoners a raised way, and a low wall is built along the way, like\n",
      "the screen over which marionette players show their puppets. Behind the\n",

      "the shadows. Suppose now that you suddenly turn them round and make them\n",
      "look with pain and grief to themselves at the real images; will they\n",
      "believe them to be real? Will not their eyes be dazzled, and will they\n",
      "not try to get away from the light to something which they are able to\n",
      "behold without blinking? And suppose further, that they are dragged up\n",
      "a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of the sun himself, will not\n",
      "their sight be darkened with the excess of light? Some time will pass\n",
      "before they get the habit of perceiving at all; and at first they will\n",
      "be able to perceive only shadows and reflections in the water; then they\n",
      "will recognize the moon and the stars, and will at length behold the sun\n",
      "in his own proper place as he is. Last of all they will conclude:--This\n",
      "is he who gives us the year and the seasons, and is the author of all\n",
      "that we see. How will they rejoice in passing from darkness to light!\n",
      "How worthless to them will seem the honours and glories of the den! But\n",
      "now imagine further, that they descend into their old habitations;--in\n",
      "that underground dwelling they will not see as well as their fellows,\n",
      "and will not be able to compete with them in the measurement of the\n",
      "shadows on the wall; there will be many jokes about the man who went on\n",
      "a visit to the sun and lost his eyes, and if they find anybody trying to\n",
      "set free and enlighten one of their number, they will put him to death,\n",
      "if they can catch him. Now the cave or den is the world of sight, the\n",
      "fire is the sun, the way upwards is the way to knowledge, and in the\n",
      "world of knowledge the idea of good is last seen and with difficulty,\n",
      "but when seen is inferred to be the author of good and right--parent of\n",
      "the lord of light in this world, and of truth and understanding in the\n",
      "other. He who attains to the beatific vision is always going upwards; he\n",
      "is unwilling to descend into political assemblies and courts of law; for\n",
      "his eyes are apt to blink at the images or shadows of images which they\n",

      "them, but the blindness which arises from fulness of light he will deem\n",
      "blessed, and pity the other; or if he laugh at the puzzled soul looking\n",
      "at the sun, he will have more reason to laugh than the inhabitants\n",
      "of the den at those who descend from above. There is a further lesson\n",
      "taught by this parable of ours. Some persons fancy that instruction is\n",
      "like giving eyes to the blind, but we say that the faculty of sight was\n",
      "always there, and that the soul only requires to be turned round towards\n",
      "the light. And this is conversion; other virtues are almost like bodily\n",
      "habits, and may be acquired in the same manner, but intelligence has\n",
      "a diviner life, and is indestructible, turning either to good or evil\n",
      "according to the direction given. Did you never observe how the mind of\n",
      "a clever rogue peers out of his eyes, and the more clearly he sees, the\n",
      "more evil he does? Now if you take such an one, and cut away from him\n",
      "those leaden weights of pleasure and desire which bind his soul to\n",
      "earth, his intelligence will be turned round, and he will behold the\n",
      "truth as clearly as he now discerns his meaner ends. And have we not\n",
      "decided that our rulers must neither be so uneducated as to have no\n",
      "fixed rule of life, nor so over-educated as to be unwilling to leave\n",
      "their paradise for the business of the world? We must choose out\n",
      "therefore the natures who are most likely to ascend to the light and\n",
      "knowledge of the good; but we must not allow them to remain in the\n",
      "region of light; they must be forced down again among the captives in\n",
      "the den to partake of their labours and honours. 'Will they not think\n",
      "this a hardship?' You should remember that our purpose in framing the\n",
      "State was not that our citizens should do what they like, but that they\n",
      "should serve the State for the common good of all. May we not fairly\n",
      "say to our philosopher,--Friend, we do you no wrong; for in other States\n",
      "philosophy grows wild, and a wild plant owes nothing to the gardener,\n",
      "but you have been trained by us to be the rulers and kings of our hive,\n",
      "and therefore we must insist on your descending into the den. You must,\n",
      "each of you, take your turn, and become able to use your eyes in the\n",
      "dark, and with a little practice you will see far better than those who\n",
      "quarrel about the shadows, whose knowledge is a dream only, whilst yours\n",
      "is a waking reality. It may be that the saint or philosopher who is best\n",
      "fitted, may also be the least inclined to rule, but necessity is laid\n",
      "upon him, and he must no longer live in the heaven of ideas. And this\n",
      "will be the salvation of the State. For those who rule must not be those\n",
      "who are desirous to rule; and, if you can offer to our citizens a better\n",
      "life than that of rulers generally is, there will be a chance that the\n",
      "rich, not only in this world's goods, but in virtue and wisdom, may\n",
      "bear rule. And the only life which is better than the life of political\n",
      "ambition is that of philosophy, which is also the best preparation for\n",
      "the government of a State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then now comes the question,--How shall we create our rulers; what way\n",
      "is there from darkness to light? The change is effected by philosophy;\n",
      "it is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but the conversion of a\n",
      "soul from night to day, from becoming to being. And what training will\n",
      "draw the soul upwards? Our former education had two branches, gymnastic,\n",
      "which was occupied with the body, and music, the sister art, which\n",
      "infused a natural harmony into mind and literature; but neither of these\n",
      "sciences gave any promise of doing what we want. Nothing remains to us\n",
      "but that universal or primary science of which all the arts and sciences\n",
      "are partakers, I mean number or calculation. 'Very true.' Including the\n",
      "art of war? 'Yes, certainly.' Then there is something ludicrous about\n",
      "Palamedes in the tragedy, coming in and saying that he had invented\n",
      "number, and had counted the ranks and set them in order. For if\n",
      "Agamemnon could not count his feet (and without number how could he?)\n",
      "he must have been a pretty sort of general indeed. No man should be a\n",
      "soldier who cannot count, and indeed he is hardly to be called a man.\n",
      "But I am not speaking of these practical applications of arithmetic, for\n",
      "number, in my view, is rather to be regarded as a conductor to thought\n",
      "and being. I will explain what I mean by the last expression:--Things\n",
      "sensible are of two kinds; the one class invite or stimulate the mind,\n",
      "while in the other the mind acquiesces. Now the stimulating class are\n",
      "the things which suggest contrast and relation. For example, suppose\n",
      "that I hold up to the eyes three fingers--a fore finger, a middle\n",
      "finger, a little finger--the sight equally recognizes all three fingers,\n",
      "but without number cannot further distinguish them. Or again, suppose\n",
      "two objects to be relatively great and small, these ideas of greatness\n",
      "and smallness are supplied not by the sense, but by the mind. And the\n",
      "perception of their contrast or relation quickens and sets in motion\n",
      "the mind, which is puzzled by the confused intimations of sense, and has\n",
      "recourse to number in order to find out whether the things indicated are\n",
      "one or more than one. Number replies that they are two and not one, and\n",
      "are to be distinguished from one another. Again, the sight beholds\n",
      "great and small, but only in a confused chaos, and not until they are\n",
      "distinguished does the question arise of their respective natures; we\n",
      "are thus led on to the distinction between the visible and intelligible.\n",
      "That was what I meant when I spoke of stimulants to the intellect; I was\n",
      "thinking of the contradictions which arise in perception. The idea\n",
      "of unity, for example, like that of a finger, does not arouse thought\n",
      "unless involving some conception of plurality; but when the one is also\n",
      "the opposite of one, the contradiction gives rise to reflection; an\n",
      "example of this is afforded by any object of sight. All number has also\n",
      "an elevating effect; it raises the mind out of the foam and flux of\n",
      "generation to the contemplation of being, having lesser military and\n",
      "retail uses also. The retail use is not required by us; but as our\n",
      "guardian is to be a soldier as well as a philosopher, the military one\n",
      "may be retained. And to our higher purpose no science can be better\n",
      "adapted; but it must be pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, not of a\n",
      "shopkeeper. It is concerned, not with visible objects, but with abstract\n",
      "truth; for numbers are pure abstractions--the true arithmetician\n",
      "indignantly denies that his unit is capable of division. When you\n",
      "divide, he insists that you are only multiplying; his 'one' is not\n",
      "material or resolvable into fractions, but an unvarying and absolute\n",
      "equality; and this proves the purely intellectual character of his\n",
      "study. Note also the great power which arithmetic has of sharpening the\n",
      "wits; no other discipline is equally severe, or an equal test of general\n",
      "ability, or equally improving to a stupid person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let our second branch of education be geometry. 'I can easily see,'\n",
      "replied Glaucon, 'that the skill of the general will be doubled by his\n",
      "knowledge of geometry.' That is a small matter; the use of geometry, to\n",
      "which I refer, is the assistance given by it in the contemplation of the\n",
      "idea of good, and the compelling the mind to look at true being, and not\n",
      "at generation only. Yet the present mode of pursuing these studies,\n",
      "as any one who is the least of a mathematician is aware, is mean and\n",
      "ridiculous; they are made to look downwards to the arts, and not upwards\n",
      "to eternal existence. The geometer is always talking of squaring,\n",
      "subtending, apposing, as if he had in view action; whereas knowledge is\n",
      "the real object of the study. It should elevate the soul, and create\n",
      "the mind of philosophy; it should raise up what has fallen down, not to\n",
      "speak of lesser uses in war and military tactics, and in the improvement\n",
      "of the faculties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shall we propose, as a third branch of our education, astronomy? 'Very\n",
      "good,' replied Glaucon; 'the knowledge of the heavens is necessary at\n",
      "once for husbandry, navigation, military tactics.' I like your way of\n",
      "giving useful reasons for everything in order to make friends of the\n",
      "world. And there is a difficulty in proving to mankind that education is\n",
      "not only useful information but a purification of the eye of the soul,\n",
      "which is better than the bodily eye, for by this alone is truth seen.\n",
      "Now, will you appeal to mankind in general or to the philosopher? or\n",
      "would you prefer to look to yourself only? 'Every man is his own best\n",
      "friend.' Then take a step backward, for we are out of order, and insert\n",
      "the third dimension which is of solids, after the second which is of\n",
      "planes, and then you may proceed to solids in motion. But solid geometry\n",
      "is not popular and has not the patronage of the State, nor is the use\n",
      "of it fully recognized; the difficulty is great, and the votaries of the\n",
      "study are conceited and impatient. Still the charm of the pursuit wins\n",
      "upon men, and, if government would lend a little assistance, there\n",
      "might be great progress made. 'Very true,' replied Glaucon; 'but do\n",
      "I understand you now to begin with plane geometry, and to place next\n",
      "geometry of solids, and thirdly, astronomy, or the motion of solids?'\n",
      "Yes, I said; my hastiness has only hindered us.\n",
      "\n",
      "'Very good, and now let us proceed to astronomy, about which I am\n",
      "willing to speak in your lofty strain. No one can fail to see that the\n",
      "contemplation of the heavens draws the soul upwards.' I am an exception,\n",
      "then; astronomy as studied at present appears to me to draw the soul\n",
      "not upwards, but downwards. Star-gazing is just looking up at the\n",
      "ceiling--no better; a man may lie on his back on land or on water--he\n",
      "may look up or look down, but there is no science in that. The vision of\n",
      "knowledge of which I speak is seen not with the eyes, but with the mind.\n",
      "All the magnificence of the heavens is but the embroidery of a copy\n",
      "which falls far short of the divine Original, and teaches nothing about\n",
      "the absolute harmonies or motions of things. Their beauty is like the\n",
      "beauty of figures drawn by the hand of Daedalus or any other great\n",
      "artist, which may be used for illustration, but no mathematician would\n",
      "seek to obtain from them true conceptions of equality or numerical\n",
      "relations. How ridiculous then to look for these in the map of the\n",
      "heavens, in which the imperfection of matter comes in everywhere as a\n",
      "disturbing element, marring the symmetry of day and night, of months and\n",
      "years, of the sun and stars in their courses. Only by problems can we\n",
      "place astronomy on a truly scientific basis. Let the heavens alone, and\n",
      "exert the intellect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, mathematics admit of other applications, as the Pythagoreans say,\n",
      "and we agree. There is a sister science of harmonical motion, adapted to\n",
      "the ear as astronomy is to the eye, and there may be other applications\n",
      "also. Let us inquire of the Pythagoreans about them, not forgetting\n",
      "that we have an aim higher than theirs, which is the relation of these\n",
      "sciences to the idea of good. The error which pervades astronomy also\n",
      "pervades harmonics. The musicians put their ears in the place of their\n",
      "minds. 'Yes,' replied Glaucon, 'I like to see them laying their ears\n",
      "alongside of their neighbours' faces--some saying, \"That's a new note,\"\n",
      "others declaring that the two notes are the same.' Yes, I said; but you\n",
      "mean the empirics who are always twisting and torturing the strings\n",
      "of the lyre, and quarrelling about the tempers of the strings; I am\n",
      "referring rather to the Pythagorean harmonists, who are almost equally\n",
      "in error. For they investigate only the numbers of the consonances which\n",
      "are heard, and ascend no higher,--of the true numerical harmony which\n",
      "is unheard, and is only to be found in problems, they have not even a\n",
      "conception. 'That last,' he said, 'must be a marvellous thing.' A thing,\n",
      "I replied, which is only useful if pursued with a view to the good.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these sciences are the prelude of the strain, and are profitable\n",
      "if they are regarded in their natural relations to one another. 'I\n",
      "dare say, Socrates,' said Glaucon; 'but such a study will be an endless\n",
      "business.' What study do you mean--of the prelude, or what? For all\n",
      "these things are only the prelude, and you surely do not suppose that a\n",
      "mere mathematician is also a dialectician? 'Certainly not. I have hardly\n",
      "ever known a mathematician who could reason.' And yet, Glaucon, is\n",
      "not true reasoning that hymn of dialectic which is the music of the\n",
      "intellectual world, and which was by us compared to the effort of sight,\n",
      "when from beholding the shadows on the wall we arrived at last at\n",
      "the images which gave the shadows? Even so the dialectical faculty\n",
      "withdrawing from sense arrives by the pure intellect at the\n",
      "contemplation of the idea of good, and never rests but at the very end\n",
      "of the intellectual world. And the royal road out of the cave into\n",
      "the light, and the blinking of the eyes at the sun and turning to\n",
      "contemplate the shadows of reality, not the shadows of an image\n",
      "only--this progress and gradual acquisition of a new faculty of sight by\n",
      "the help of the mathematical sciences, is the elevation of the soul to\n",
      "the contemplation of the highest ideal of being.\n",
      "\n",
      "'So far, I agree with you. But now, leaving the prelude, let us proceed\n",
      "to the hymn. What, then, is the nature of dialectic, and what are the\n",
      "paths which lead thither?' Dear Glaucon, you cannot follow me here.\n",
      "There can be no revelation of the absolute truth to one who has not been\n",
      "disciplined in the previous sciences. But that there is a science of\n",
      "absolute truth, which is attained in some way very different from\n",
      "those now practised, I am confident. For all other arts or sciences are\n",
      "relative to human needs and opinions; and the mathematical sciences are\n",
      "but a dream or hypothesis of true being, and never analyse their own\n",
      "principles. Dialectic alone rises to the principle which is above\n",
      "hypotheses, converting and gently leading the eye of the soul out of the\n",
      "barbarous slough of ignorance into the light of the upper world, with\n",
      "the help of the sciences which we have been describing--sciences, as\n",
      "they are often termed, although they require some other name, implying\n",
      "greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science, and this\n",
      "in our previous sketch was understanding. And so we get four names--two\n",
      "for intellect, and two for opinion,--reason or mind, understanding,\n",
      "faith, perception of shadows--which make a proportion--\n",
      "being:becoming::intellect:opinion--and science:belief::understanding:\n",
      "perception of shadows. Dialectic may be further described as that\n",
      "science which defines and explains the essence or being of each nature,\n",
      "which distinguishes and abstracts the good, and is ready to do battle\n",
      "against all opponents in the cause of good. To him who is not a\n",
      "dialectician life is but a sleepy dream; and many a man is in his grave\n",
      "before his is well waked up. And would you have the future rulers of\n",
      "your ideal State intelligent beings, or stupid as posts? 'Certainly not\n",
      "the latter.' Then you must train them in dialectic, which will teach\n",
      "them to ask and answer questions, and is the coping-stone of the\n",
      "sciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dare say that you have not forgotten how our rulers were chosen; and\n",
      "the process of selection may be carried a step further:--As before, they\n",
      "must be constant and valiant, good-looking, and of noble manners, but\n",
      "now they must also have natural ability which education will improve;\n",
      "that is to say, they must be quick at learning, capable of mental toil,\n",
      "retentive, solid, diligent natures, who combine intellectual with\n",
      "moral virtues; not lame and one-sided, diligent in bodily exercise\n",
      "and indolent in mind, or conversely; not a maimed soul, which hates\n",
      "falsehood and yet unintentionally is always wallowing in the mire of\n",
      "ignorance; not a bastard or feeble person, but sound in wind and limb,\n",
      "and in perfect condition for the great gymnastic trial of the mind.\n",
      "Justice herself can find no fault with natures such as these; and they\n",
      "will be the saviours of our State; disciples of another sort would\n",
      "only make philosophy more ridiculous than she is at present. Forgive\n",
      "my enthusiasm; I am becoming excited; but when I see her trampled\n",
      "underfoot, I am angry at the authors of her disgrace. 'I did not notice\n",
      "that you were more excited than you ought to have been.' But I felt that\n",
      "I was. Now do not let us forget another point in the selection of our\n",
      "disciples--that they must be young and not old. For Solon is mistaken\n",
      "in saying that an old man can be always learning; youth is the time of\n",
      "study, and here we must remember that the mind is free and dainty, and,\n",
      "unlike the body, must not be made to work against the grain. Learning\n",
      "should be at first a sort of play, in which the natural bent is\n",
      "detected. As in training them for war, the young dogs should at first\n",
      "only taste blood; but when the necessary gymnastics are over which\n",
      "during two or three years divide life between sleep and bodily exercise,\n",
      "then the education of the soul will become a more serious matter. At\n",
      "twenty years of age, a selection must be made of the more promising\n",
      "disciples, with whom a new epoch of education will begin. The sciences\n",
      "which they have hitherto learned in fragments will now be brought into\n",
      "relation with each other and with true being; for the power of combining\n",
      "them is the test of speculative and dialectical ability. And afterwards\n",
      "at thirty a further selection shall be made of those who are able to\n",
      "withdraw from the world of sense into the abstraction of ideas. But\n",
      "at this point, judging from present experience, there is a danger that\n",
      "dialectic may be the source of many evils. The danger may be illustrated\n",
      "by a parallel case:--Imagine a person who has been brought up in wealth\n",
      "and luxury amid a crowd of flatterers, and who is suddenly informed that\n",
      "he is a supposititious son. He has hitherto honoured his reputed parents\n",
      "and disregarded the flatterers, and now he does the reverse. This is\n",
      "just what happens with a man's principles. There are certain doctrines\n",
      "which he learnt at home and which exercised a parental authority\n",
      "over him. Presently he finds that imputations are cast upon them; a\n",
      "troublesome querist comes and asks, 'What is the just and good?'\n",
      "or proves that virtue is vice and vice virtue, and his mind becomes\n",
      "unsettled, and he ceases to love, honour, and obey them as he has\n",
      "hitherto done. He is seduced into the life of pleasure, and becomes\n",
      "a lawless person and a rogue. The case of such speculators is very\n",
      "pitiable, and, in order that our thirty years' old pupils may not\n",
      "require this pity, let us take every possible care that young persons do\n",
      "not study philosophy too early. For a young man is a sort of puppy\n",
      "who only plays with an argument; and is reasoned into and out of his\n",
      "opinions every day; he soon begins to believe nothing, and brings\n",
      "himself and philosophy into discredit. A man of thirty does not run\n",
      "on in this way; he will argue and not merely contradict, and adds new\n",
      "honour to philosophy by the sobriety of his conduct. What time shall we\n",
      "allow for this second gymnastic training of the soul?--say, twice the\n",
      "time required for the gymnastics of the body; six, or perhaps five\n",
      "years, to commence at thirty, and then for fifteen years let the student\n",
      "go down into the den, and command armies, and gain experience of life.\n",
      "At fifty let him return to the end of all things, and have his eyes\n",
      "uplifted to the idea of good, and order his life after that pattern; if\n",
      "necessary, taking his turn at the helm of State, and training up others\n",
      "to be his successors. When his time comes he shall depart in peace to\n",

      "previous discussion; at the same time casting a glance onward at the\n",

      "There seem to be two great aims in the philosophy of Plato,--first, to\n",
      "realize abstractions; secondly, to connect them. According to him, the\n",
      "true education is that which draws men from becoming to being, and to\n",
      "a comprehensive survey of all being. He desires to develop in the human\n",
      "mind the faculty of seeing the universal in all things; until at last\n",
      "the particulars of sense drop away and the universal alone remains. He\n",
      "then seeks to combine the universals which he has disengaged from sense,\n",
      "not perceiving that the correlation of them has no other basis but the\n",
      "common use of language. He never understands that abstractions, as Hegel\n",
      "says, are 'mere abstractions'--of use when employed in the arrangement\n",
      "of facts, but adding nothing to the sum of knowledge when pursued apart\n",
      "from them, or with reference to an imaginary idea of good. Still the\n",
      "exercise of the faculty of abstraction apart from facts has enlarged the\n",
      "mind, and played a great part in the education of the human race.\n",
      "Plato appreciated the value of this faculty, and saw that it might be\n",
      "quickened by the study of number and relation. All things in which\n",
      "there is opposition or proportion are suggestive of reflection. The\n",
      "mere impression of sense evokes no power of thought or of mind, but when\n",
      "sensible objects ask to be compared and distinguished, then philosophy\n",
      "begins. The science of arithmetic first suggests such distinctions. The\n",
      "follow in order the other sciences of plain and solid geometry, and of\n",
      "solids in motion, one branch of which is astronomy or the harmony of\n",

      "figure in themselves. He too will be apt to depreciate their application\n",
      "to the arts. He will observe that Plato has a conception of geometry,\n",
      "in which figures are to be dispensed with; thus in a distant and\n",
      "shadowy way seeming to anticipate the possibility of working geometrical\n",
      "problems by a more general mode of analysis. He will remark with\n",
      "interest on the backward state of solid geometry, which, alas! was not\n",
      "encouraged by the aid of the State in the age of Plato; and he will\n",
      "recognize the grasp of Plato's mind in his ability to conceive of\n",
      "one science of solids in motion including the earth as well as the\n",
      "heavens,--not forgetting to notice the intimation to which allusion has\n",
      "been already made, that besides astronomy and harmonics the science\n",
      "of solids in motion may have other applications. Still more will he be\n",

      "when these sciences hardly existed, to say that they must be studied in\n",
      "relation to one another, and to the idea of good, or common principle\n",
      "of truth and being. But he will also see (and perhaps without surprise)\n",
      "that in that stage of physical and mathematical knowledge, Plato has\n",
      "fallen into the error of supposing that he can construct the heavens a\n",
      "priori by mathematical problems, and determine the principles of harmony\n",
      "irrespective of the adaptation of sounds to the human ear. The illusion\n",
      "was a natural one in that age and country. The simplicity and certainty\n",
      "of astronomy and harmonics seemed to contrast with the variation and\n",
      "complexity of the world of sense; hence the circumstance that there was\n",
      "some elementary basis of fact, some measurement of distance or time or\n",
      "vibrations on which they must ultimately rest, was overlooked by him.\n",
      "The modern predecessors of Newton fell into errors equally great; and\n",
      "Plato can hardly be said to have been very far wrong, or may even claim\n",
      "a sort of prophetic insight into the subject, when we consider that\n",
      "the greater part of astronomy at the present day consists of abstract\n",

      "The metaphysical philosopher from his point of view recognizes\n",
      "mathematics as an instrument of education,--which strengthens the\n",
      "power of attention, developes the sense of order and the faculty of\n",
      "construction, and enables the mind to grasp under simple formulae the\n",
      "quantitative differences of physical phenomena. But while acknowledging\n",
      "their value in education, he sees also that they have no connexion with\n",
      "our higher moral and intellectual ideas. In the attempt which Plato\n",
      "makes to connect them, we easily trace the influences of ancient\n",
      "Pythagorean notions. There is no reason to suppose that he is speaking\n",
      "of the ideal numbers; but he is describing numbers which are pure\n",
      "abstractions, to which he assigns a real and separate existence, which,\n",
      "as 'the teachers of the art' (meaning probably the Pythagoreans) would\n",
      "have affirmed, repel all attempts at subdivision, and in which unity and\n",
      "every other number are conceived of as absolute. The truth and certainty\n",
      "of numbers, when thus disengaged from phenomena, gave them a kind of\n",
      "sacredness in the eyes of an ancient philosopher. Nor is it easy to say\n",
      "how far ideas of order and fixedness may have had a moral and elevating\n",
      "influence on the minds of men, 'who,' in the words of the Timaeus,\n",
      "'might learn to regulate their erring lives according to them.' It is\n",
      "worthy of remark that the old Pythagorean ethical symbols still exist as\n",
      "figures of speech among ourselves. And those who in modern times see the\n",

      "Two passages seem to require more particular explanations. First, that\n",
      "which relates to the analysis of vision. The difficulty in this passage\n",
      "may be explained, like many others, from differences in the modes of\n",
      "conception prevailing among ancient and modern thinkers. To us, the\n",
      "perceptions of sense are inseparable from the act of the mind which\n",
      "accompanies them. The consciousness of form, colour, distance, is\n",
      "indistinguishable from the simple sensation, which is the medium of\n",
      "them. Whereas to Plato sense is the Heraclitean flux of sense, not the\n",
      "vision of objects in the order in which they actually present themselves\n",
      "to the experienced sight, but as they may be imagined to appear confused\n",
      "and blurred to the half-awakened eye of the infant. The first action of\n",
      "the mind is aroused by the attempt to set in order this chaos, and\n",
      "the reason is required to frame distinct conceptions under which\n",
      "the confused impressions of sense may be arranged. Hence arises\n",

      "The second difficulty relates to Plato's conception of harmonics.\n",
      "Three classes of harmonists are distinguished by him:--first, the\n",

      "on music he was to consult Damon--they are acknowledged to be masters\n",
      "in the art, but are altogether deficient in the knowledge of its higher\n",
      "import and relation to the good; secondly, the mere empirics, whom\n",
      "Glaucon appears to confuse with them, and whom both he and Socrates\n",
      "ludicrously describe as experimenting by mere auscultation on the\n",
      "intervals of sounds. Both of these fall short in different degrees of\n",
      "the Platonic idea of harmony, which must be studied in a purely\n",

      "Imperialism, to be the medium through which they viewed contemporary\n",
      "events. Or perhaps the long projecting shadow of some existing\n",

      "deficient in various degrees, were all of them worth inspecting with\n",
      "a view to determining the relative happiness or misery of the best or\n",
      "worst man. Then Polemarchus and Adeimantus interrupted you, and this led\n",
      "to another argument,--and so here we are.' Suppose that we put ourselves\n",
      "again in the same position, and do you repeat your question. 'I should\n",
      "like to know of what constitutions you were speaking?' Besides the\n",
      "perfect State there are only four of any note in Hellas:--first, the\n",
      "famous Lacedaemonian or Cretan commonwealth; secondly, oligarchy, a\n",
      "State full of evils; thirdly, democracy, which follows next in order;\n",
      "fourthly, tyranny, which is the disease or death of all government.\n",
      "Now, States are not made of 'oak and rock,' but of flesh and blood; and\n",
      "therefore as there are five States there must be five human natures in\n",
      "individuals, which correspond to them. And first, there is the ambitious\n",
      "nature, which answers to the Lacedaemonian State; secondly, the\n",
      "oligarchical nature; thirdly, the democratical; and fourthly, the\n",
      "tyrannical. This last will have to be compared with the perfectly just,\n",
      "which is the fifth, that we may know which is the happier, and then we\n",
      "shall be able to determine whether the argument of Thrasymachus or our\n",
      "own is the more convincing. And as before we began with the State and\n",
      "went on to the individual, so now, beginning with timocracy, let us\n",
      "go on to the timocratical man, and then proceed to the other forms of\n",
      "government, and the individuals who answer to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how did timocracy arise out of the perfect State? Plainly, like\n",
      "all changes of government, from division in the rulers. But whence came\n",
      "division? 'Sing, heavenly Muses,' as Homer says;--let them condescend to\n",
      "answer us, as if we were children, to whom they put on a solemn face\n",
      "in jest. 'And what will they say?' They will say that human things are\n",
      "fated to decay, and even the perfect State will not escape from this\n",
      "law of destiny, when 'the wheel comes full circle' in a period short or\n",
      "long. Plants or animals have times of fertility and sterility, which the\n",
      "intelligence of rulers because alloyed by sense will not enable them to\n",
      "ascertain, and children will be born out of season. For whereas divine\n",
      "creations are in a perfect cycle or number, the human creation is in\n",
      "a number which declines from perfection, and has four terms and three\n",
      "intervals of numbers, increasing, waning, assimilating, dissimilating,\n",
      "and yet perfectly commensurate with each other. The base of the number\n",
      "with a fourth added (or which is 3:4), multiplied by five and cubed,\n",
      "gives two harmonies:--the first a square number, which is a hundred\n",
      "times the base (or a hundred times a hundred); the second, an oblong,\n",
      "being a hundred squares of the rational diameter of a figure the side of\n",
      "which is five, subtracting one from each square or two perfect squares\n",
      "from all, and adding a hundred cubes of three. This entire number is\n",
      "geometrical and contains the rule or law of generation. When this law is\n",
      "neglected marriages will be unpropitious; the inferior offspring who are\n",
      "then born will in time become the rulers; the State will decline, and\n",
      "education fall into decay; gymnastic will be preferred to music, and\n",
      "the gold and silver and brass and iron will form a chaotic mass--thus\n",
      "division will arise. Such is the Muses' answer to our question. 'And a\n",
      "true answer, of course:--but what more have they to say?' They say that\n",
      "the two races, the iron and brass, and the silver and gold, will draw\n",
      "the State different ways;--the one will take to trade and moneymaking,\n",
      "and the others, having the true riches and not caring for money, will\n",
      "resist them: the contest will end in a compromise; they will agree to\n",
      "have private property, and will enslave their fellow-citizens who were\n",
      "once their friends and nurturers. But they will retain their warlike\n",
      "character, and will be chiefly occupied in fighting and exercising rule.\n",
      "Thus arises timocracy, which is intermediate between aristocracy and\n",
      "oligarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new form of government resembles the ideal in obedience to rulers\n",
      "and contempt for trade, and having common meals, and in devotion\n",
      "to warlike and gymnastic exercises. But corruption has crept into\n",
      "philosophy, and simplicity of character, which was once her note, is now\n",
      "looked for only in the military class. Arts of war begin to prevail over\n",
      "arts of peace; the ruler is no longer a philosopher; as in oligarchies,\n",
      "there springs up among them an extravagant love of gain--get another\n",
      "man's and save your own, is their principle; and they have dark places\n",
      "in which they hoard their gold and silver, for the use of their women\n",
      "and others; they take their pleasures by stealth, like boys who are\n",
      "running away from their father--the law; and their education is not\n",
      "inspired by the Muse, but imposed by the strong arm of power. The\n",
      "leading characteristic of this State is party spirit and ambition.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what manner of man answers to such a State? 'In love of contention,'\n",
      "replied Adeimantus, 'he will be like our friend Glaucon.' In that\n",
      "respect, perhaps, but not in others. He is self-asserting and\n",
      "ill-educated, yet fond of literature, although not himself a\n",
      "speaker,--fierce with slaves, but obedient to rulers, a lover of power\n",
      "and honour, which he hopes to gain by deeds of arms,--fond, too, of\n",
      "gymnastics and of hunting. As he advances in years he grows avaricious,\n",
      "for he has lost philosophy, which is the only saviour and guardian of\n",
      "men. His origin is as follows:--His father is a good man dwelling in an\n",
      "ill-ordered State, who has retired from politics in order that he may\n",
      "lead a quiet life. His mother is angry at her loss of precedence among\n",
      "other women; she is disgusted at her husband's selfishness, and she\n",
      "expatiates to her son on the unmanliness and indolence of his father.\n",
      "The old family servant takes up the tale, and says to the youth:--'When\n",
      "you grow up you must be more of a man than your father.' All the world\n",
      "are agreed that he who minds his own business is an idiot, while a\n",
      "busybody is highly honoured and esteemed. The young man compares this\n",
      "spirit with his father's words and ways, and as he is naturally well\n",
      "disposed, although he has suffered from evil influences, he rests at a\n",
      "middle point and becomes ambitious and a lover of honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now let us set another city over against another man. The next form\n",
      "of government is oligarchy, in which the rule is of the rich only; nor\n",
      "is it difficult to see how such a State arises. The decline begins with\n",
      "the possession of gold and silver; illegal modes of expenditure are\n",
      "invented; one draws another on, and the multitude are infected; riches\n",
      "outweigh virtue; lovers of money take the place of lovers of honour;\n",
      "misers of politicians; and, in time, political privileges are confined\n",
      "by law to the rich, who do not shrink from violence in order to effect\n",
      "their purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus much of the origin,--let us next consider the evils of oligarchy.\n",
      "Would a man who wanted to be safe on a voyage take a bad pilot because\n",
      "he was rich, or refuse a good one because he was poor? And does not the\n",
      "analogy apply still more to the State? And there are yet greater evils:\n",
      "two nations are struggling together in one--the rich and the poor; and\n",
      "the rich dare not put arms into the hands of the poor, and are unwilling\n",
      "to pay for defenders out of their own money. And have we not already\n",
      "condemned that State in which the same persons are warriors as well\n",
      "as shopkeepers? The greatest evil of all is that a man may sell his\n",
      "property and have no place in the State; while there is one class which\n",
      "has enormous wealth, the other is entirely destitute. But observe that\n",
      "these destitutes had not really any more of the governing nature in them\n",
      "when they were rich than now that they are poor; they were miserable\n",
      "spendthrifts always. They are the drones of the hive; only whereas the\n",
      "actual drone is unprovided by nature with a sting, the two-legged things\n",
      "whom we call drones are some of them without stings and some of them\n",
      "have dreadful stings; in other words, there are paupers and there are\n",
      "rogues. These are never far apart; and in oligarchical cities, where\n",
      "nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler, you will find abundance\n",
      "of both. And this evil state of society originates in bad education and\n",
      "bad government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like State, like man,--the change in the latter begins with the\n",
      "representative of timocracy; he walks at first in the ways of his\n",
      "father, who may have been a statesman, or general, perhaps; and\n",
      "presently he sees him 'fallen from his high estate,' the victim of\n",
      "informers, dying in prison or exile, or by the hand of the executioner.\n",
      "The lesson which he thus receives, makes him cautious; he leaves\n",
      "politics, represses his pride, and saves pence. Avarice is enthroned as\n",
      "his bosom's lord, and assumes the style of the Great King; the rational\n",
      "and spirited elements sit humbly on the ground at either side, the one\n",
      "immersed in calculation, the other absorbed in the admiration of\n",
      "wealth. The love of honour turns to love of money; the conversion\n",
      "is instantaneous. The man is mean, saving, toiling, the slave of one\n",
      "passion which is the master of the rest: Is he not the very image of the\n",
      "State? He has had no education, or he would never have allowed the blind\n",
      "god of riches to lead the dance within him. And being uneducated he will\n",
      "have many slavish desires, some beggarly, some knavish, breeding in his\n",
      "soul. If he is the trustee of an orphan, and has the power to defraud,\n",
      "he will soon prove that he is not without the will, and that his\n",
      "passions are only restrained by fear and not by reason. Hence he leads a\n",
      "divided existence; in which the better desires mostly prevail. But when\n",
      "he is contending for prizes and other distinctions, he is afraid to\n",
      "incur a loss which is to be repaid only by barren honour; in time of\n",
      "war he fights with a small part of his resources, and usually keeps his\n",
      "money and loses the victory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next comes democracy and the democratic man, out of oligarchy and\n",
      "the oligarchical man. Insatiable avarice is the ruling passion of an\n",
      "oligarchy; and they encourage expensive habits in order that they may\n",
      "gain by the ruin of extravagant youth. Thus men of family often lose\n",
      "their property or rights of citizenship; but they remain in the city,\n",
      "full of hatred against the new owners of their estates and ripe for\n",
      "revolution. The usurer with stooping walk pretends not to see them;\n",
      "he passes by, and leaves his sting--that is, his money--in some other\n",
      "victim; and many a man has to pay the parent or principal sum multiplied\n",
      "into a family of children, and is reduced into a state of dronage by\n",
      "him. The only way of diminishing the evil is either to limit a man in\n",
      "his use of his property, or to insist that he shall lend at his own\n",
      "risk. But the ruling class do not want remedies; they care only for\n",
      "money, and are as careless of virtue as the poorest of the citizens.\n",
      "Now there are occasions on which the governors and the governed meet\n",
      "together,--at festivals, on a journey, voyaging or fighting. The sturdy\n",
      "pauper finds that in the hour of danger he is not despised; he sees\n",
      "the rich man puffing and panting, and draws the conclusion which he\n",
      "privately imparts to his companions,--'that our people are not good for\n",
      "much;' and as a sickly frame is made ill by a mere touch from without,\n",
      "or sometimes without external impulse is ready to fall to pieces of\n",
      "itself, so from the least cause, or with none at all, the city falls ill\n",
      "and fights a battle for life or death. And democracy comes into power\n",
      "when the poor are the victors, killing some and exiling some, and giving\n",
      "equal shares in the government to all the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manner of life in such a State is that of democrats; there is\n",
      "freedom and plainness of speech, and every man does what is right in\n",
      "his own eyes, and has his own way of life. Hence arise the most various\n",
      "developments of character; the State is like a piece of embroidery of\n",
      "which the colours and figures are the manners of men, and there are many\n",
      "who, like women and children, prefer this variety to real beauty and\n",
      "excellence. The State is not one but many, like a bazaar at which you\n",
      "can buy anything. The great charm is, that you may do as you like; you\n",
      "may govern if you like, let it alone if you like; go to war and make\n",
      "peace if you feel disposed, and all quite irrespective of anybody\n",
      "else. When you condemn men to death they remain alive all the same; a\n",
      "gentleman is desired to go into exile, and he stalks about the streets\n",
      "like a hero; and nobody sees him or cares for him. Observe, too,\n",
      "how grandly Democracy sets her foot upon all our fine theories of\n",
      "education,--how little she cares for the training of her statesmen! The\n",
      "only qualification which she demands is the profession of patriotism.\n",
      "Such is democracy;--a pleasing, lawless, various sort of government,\n",
      "distributing equality to equals and unequals alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now inspect the individual democrat; and first, as in the case\n",
      "of the State, we will trace his antecedents. He is the son of a miserly\n",
      "oligarch, and has been taught by him to restrain the love of unnecessary\n",
      "pleasures. Perhaps I ought to explain this latter term:--Necessary\n",
      "pleasures are those which are good, and which we cannot do without;\n",
      "unnecessary pleasures are those which do no good, and of which the\n",
      "desire might be eradicated by early training. For example, the pleasures\n",
      "of eating and drinking are necessary and healthy, up to a certain point;\n",
      "beyond that point they are alike hurtful to body and mind, and the\n",
      "excess may be avoided. When in excess, they may be rightly called\n",
      "expensive pleasures, in opposition to the useful ones. And the drone, as\n",
      "we called him, is the slave of these unnecessary pleasures and desires,\n",
      "whereas the miserly oligarch is subject only to the necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The oligarch changes into the democrat in the following manner:--The\n",
      "youth who has had a miserly bringing up, gets a taste of the drone's\n",
      "honey; he meets with wild companions, who introduce him to every new\n",
      "pleasure. As in the State, so in the individual, there are allies on\n",
      "both sides, temptations from without and passions from within; there is\n",
      "reason also and external influences of parents and friends in alliance\n",
      "with the oligarchical principle; and the two factions are in violent\n",
      "conflict with one another. Sometimes the party of order prevails, but\n",
      "then again new desires and new disorders arise, and the whole mob of\n",
      "passions gets possession of the Acropolis, that is to say, the soul,\n",
      "which they find void and unguarded by true words and works. Falsehoods\n",
      "and illusions ascend to take their place; the prodigal goes back into\n",
      "the country of the Lotophagi or drones, and openly dwells there. And if\n",
      "any offer of alliance or parley of individual elders comes from home,\n",
      "the false spirits shut the gates of the castle and permit no one to\n",
      "enter,--there is a battle, and they gain the victory; and straightway\n",
      "making alliance with the desires, they banish modesty, which they call\n",
      "folly, and send temperance over the border. When the house has been\n",
      "swept and garnished, they dress up the exiled vices, and, crowning them\n",
      "with garlands, bring them back under new names. Insolence they call good\n",
      "breeding, anarchy freedom, waste magnificence, impudence courage. Such\n",
      "is the process by which the youth passes from the necessary pleasures to\n",
      "the unnecessary. After a while he divides his time impartially between\n",
      "them; and perhaps, when he gets older and the violence of passion\n",
      "has abated, he restores some of the exiles and lives in a sort of\n",
      "equilibrium, indulging first one pleasure and then another; and if\n",
      "reason comes and tells him that some pleasures are good and honourable,\n",
      "and others bad and vile, he shakes his head and says that he can make\n",
      "no distinction between them. Thus he lives in the fancy of the hour;\n",
      "sometimes he takes to drink, and then he turns abstainer; he practises\n",
      "in the gymnasium or he does nothing at all; then again he would be a\n",
      "philosopher or a politician; or again, he would be a warrior or a man of\n",
      "business; he is\n",
      "\n",
      "   'Every thing by starts and nothing long.'\n",
      "\n",
      "There remains still the finest and fairest of all men and all\n",
      "States--tyranny and the tyrant. Tyranny springs from democracy much as\n",
      "democracy springs from oligarchy. Both arise from excess; the one from\n",
      "excess of wealth, the other from excess of freedom. 'The great natural\n",
      "good of life,' says the democrat, 'is freedom.' And this exclusive love\n",
      "of freedom and regardlessness of everything else, is the cause of the\n",
      "change from democracy to tyranny. The State demands the strong wine of\n",
      "freedom, and unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught, punishes\n",
      "and insults them; equality and fraternity of governors and governed is\n",
      "the approved principle. Anarchy is the law, not of the State only, but\n",
      "of private houses, and extends even to the animals. Father and son,\n",
      "citizen and foreigner, teacher and pupil, old and young, are all on a\n",
      "level; fathers and teachers fear their sons and pupils, and the wisdom\n",
      "of the young man is a match for the elder, and the old imitate the\n",
      "jaunty manners of the young because they are afraid of being thought\n",
      "morose. Slaves are on a level with their masters and mistresses, and\n",
      "there is no difference between men and women. Nay, the very animals in\n",
      "a democratic State have a freedom which is unknown in other places. The\n",
      "she-dogs are as good as their she-mistresses, and horses and asses march\n",
      "along with dignity and run their noses against anybody who comes in\n",
      "their way. 'That has often been my experience.' At last the citizens\n",
      "become so sensitive that they cannot endure the yoke of laws, written or\n",
      "unwritten; they would have no man call himself their master. Such is the\n",
      "glorious beginning of things out of which tyranny springs. 'Glorious,\n",
      "indeed; but what is to follow?' The ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of\n",
      "democracy; for there is a law of contraries; the excess of freedom\n",
      "passes into the excess of slavery, and the greater the freedom the\n",
      "greater the slavery. You will remember that in the oligarchy were found\n",
      "two classes--rogues and paupers, whom we compared to drones with and\n",
      "without stings. These two classes are to the State what phlegm and bile\n",
      "are to the human body; and the State-physician, or legislator, must get\n",
      "rid of them, just as the bee-master keeps the drones out of the hive.\n",
      "Now in a democracy, too, there are drones, but they are more numerous\n",
      "and more dangerous than in the oligarchy; there they are inert and\n",
      "unpractised, here they are full of life and animation; and the keener\n",
      "sort speak and act, while the others buzz about the bema and prevent\n",
      "their opponents from being heard. And there is another class in\n",
      "democratic States, of respectable, thriving individuals, who can be\n",
      "squeezed when the drones have need of their possessions; there is\n",
      "moreover a third class, who are the labourers and the artisans, and\n",
      "they make up the mass of the people. When the people meet, they\n",
      "are omnipotent, but they cannot be brought together unless they are\n",
      "attracted by a little honey; and the rich are made to supply the honey,\n",
      "of which the demagogues keep the greater part themselves, giving a taste\n",
      "only to the mob. Their victims attempt to resist; they are driven mad\n",
      "by the stings of the drones, and so become downright oligarchs in\n",
      "self-defence. Then follow informations and convictions for treason. The\n",
      "people have some protector whom they nurse into greatness, and from this\n",
      "root the tree of tyranny springs. The nature of the change is indicated\n",
      "in the old fable of the temple of Zeus Lycaeus, which tells how he who\n",
      "tastes human flesh mixed up with the flesh of other victims will turn\n",
      "into a wolf. Even so the protector, who tastes human blood, and slays\n",
      "some and exiles others with or without law, who hints at abolition of\n",
      "debts and division of lands, must either perish or become a wolf--that\n",
      "is, a tyrant. Perhaps he is driven out, but he soon comes back from\n",
      "exile; and then if his enemies cannot get rid of him by lawful means,\n",
      "they plot his assassination. Thereupon the friend of the people makes\n",
      "his well-known request to them for a body-guard, which they readily\n",
      "grant, thinking only of his danger and not of their own. Now let the\n",
      "rich man make to himself wings, for he will never run away again if he\n",
      "does not do so then. And the Great Protector, having crushed all his\n",
      "rivals, stands proudly erect in the chariot of State, a full-blown\n",
      "tyrant: Let us enquire into the nature of his happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early days of his tyranny he smiles and beams upon everybody; he\n",
      "is not a 'dominus,' no, not he: he has only come to put an end to debt\n",
      "and the monopoly of land. Having got rid of foreign enemies, he makes\n",
      "himself necessary to the State by always going to war. He is thus\n",
      "enabled to depress the poor by heavy taxes, and so keep them at work;\n",
      "and he can get rid of bolder spirits by handing them over to the enemy.\n",
      "Then comes unpopularity; some of his old associates have the courage to\n",
      "oppose him. The consequence is, that he has to make a purgation of the\n",
      "State; but, unlike the physician who purges away the bad, he must get\n",
      "rid of the high-spirited, the wise and the wealthy; for he has no choice\n",
      "between death and a life of shame and dishonour. And the more hated he\n",
      "is, the more he will require trusty guards; but how will he obtain them?\n",

      "what is right in his own eyes. Of a people animated by a common spirit\n",
      "of liberty, rising as one man to repel the Persian host, which is the\n",

      "mathematician, though unfamiliar to us: (3) that 216 is the cube of\n",

      "of the school seems to point in the same direction: (8) that the\n",
      "Pythagorean triangle is called also the figure of marriage (Greek).\n",
      "\n",
      "But though agreeing with Dr. Donaldson thus far, I see no reason for\n",
      "supposing, as he does, that the first or perfect number is the world,\n",
      "the human or imperfect number the state; nor has he given any proof that\n",
      "the second harmony is a cube. Nor do I think that (Greek) can mean\n",
      "'two incommensurables,' which he arbitrarily assumes to be 2 and 3,\n",
      "but rather, as the preceding clause implies, (Greek), i.e. two square\n",
      "numbers based upon irrational diameters of a figure the side of which is\n",

      "The greatest objection to the translation is the sense given to the\n",

      "numbers of the Pythagorean triangle. But the coincidences in the numbers\n",
      "which follow are in favour of the explanation. The first harmony of 400,\n",

      "point of interest is that Plato should have used such a symbol, and\n",
      "that so much of the Pythagorean spirit should have prevailed in him. His\n",
      "general meaning is that divine creation is perfect, and is represented\n",
      "or presided over by a perfect or cyclical number; human generation is\n",
      "imperfect, and represented or presided over by an imperfect number or\n",

      "the convenience of the number for division; it is also made up of\n",
      "the first seven digits multiplied by one another. The contrast of the\n",
      "perfect and imperfect number may have been easily suggested by the\n",

      "is both pleasure and pain. But can that which is neither become both?\n",
      "Again, pleasure and pain are motions, and the absence of them is rest;\n",
      "but if so, how can the absence of either of them be the other? Thus\n",

      "witchery of the senses. And these are not the only pleasures, for there\n",
      "are others which have no preceding pains. Pure pleasure then is not the\n",
      "absence of pain, nor pure pain the absence of pleasure; although most of\n",
      "the pleasures which reach the mind through the body are reliefs of\n",
      "pain, and have not only their reactions when they depart, but their\n",
      "anticipations before they come. They can be best described in a simile.\n",
      "There is in nature an upper, lower, and middle region, and he who passes\n",
      "from the lower to the middle imagines that he is going up and is already\n",
      "in the upper world; and if he were taken back again would think,\n",
      "and truly think, that he was descending. All this arises out of his\n",

      "The man who compares grey with black, calls grey white; and the man who\n",
      "compares absence of pain with pain, calls the absence of pain pleasure.\n",
      "Again, hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body, ignorance and folly\n",
      "of the soul; and food is the satisfaction of the one, knowledge of the\n",
      "other. Now which is the purer satisfaction--that of eating and drinking,\n",
      "or that of knowledge? Consider the matter thus: The satisfaction of\n",
      "that which has more existence is truer than of that which has less. The\n",
      "invariable and immortal has a more real existence than the variable\n",
      "and mortal, and has a corresponding measure of knowledge and truth. The\n",
      "soul, again, has more existence and truth and knowledge than the body,\n",
      "and is therefore more really satisfied and has a more natural pleasure.\n",
      "Those who feast only on earthly food, are always going at random up\n",
      "to the middle and down again; but they never pass into the true upper\n",
      "world, or have a taste of true pleasure. They are like fatted beasts,\n",
      "full of gluttony and sensuality, and ready to kill one another by reason\n",
      "of their insatiable lust; for they are not filled with true being, and\n",
      "their vessel is leaky (Gorgias). Their pleasures are mere shadows of\n",
      "pleasure, mixed with pain, coloured and intensified by contrast,\n",
      "and therefore intensely desired; and men go fighting about them, as\n",

      "altogether from law and reason. Nor can the measure of his inferiority\n",
      "be told, except in a figure. The tyrant is the third removed from the\n",
      "oligarch, and has therefore, not a shadow of his pleasure, but the\n",
      "shadow of a shadow only. The oligarch, again, is thrice removed from\n",
      "the king, and thus we get the formula 3 x 3, which is the number of a\n",
      "surface, representing the shadow which is the tyrant's pleasure, and\n",

      "1. Plato's account of pleasure is remarkable for moderation, and in\n",
      "this respect contrasts with the later Platonists and the views which are\n",
      "attributed to them by Aristotle. He is not, like the Cynics, opposed\n",
      "to all pleasure, but rather desires that the several parts of the\n",
      "soul shall have their natural satisfaction; he even agrees with the\n",
      "Epicureans in describing pleasure as something more than the absence of\n",
      "pain. This is proved by the circumstance that there are pleasures which\n",
      "have no antecedent pains (as he also remarks in the Philebus), such as\n",
      "the pleasures of smell, and also the pleasures of hope and anticipation.\n",
      "In the previous book he had made the distinction between necessary\n",
      "and unnecessary pleasure, which is repeated by Aristotle, and he now\n",
      "observes that there are a further class of 'wild beast' pleasures,\n",
      "corresponding to Aristotle's (Greek). He dwells upon the relative and\n",
      "unreal character of sensual pleasures and the illusion which arises out\n",
      "of the contrast of pleasure and pain, pointing out the superiority of\n",
      "the pleasures of reason, which are at rest, over the fleeting pleasures\n",
      "of sense and emotion. The pre-eminence of royal pleasure is shown by\n",
      "the fact that reason is able to form a judgment of the lower pleasures,\n",
      "while the two lower parts of the soul are incapable of judging the\n",
      "pleasures of reason. Thus, in his treatment of pleasure, as in many\n",
      "other subjects, the philosophy of Plato is 'sawn up into quantities' by\n",
      "Aristotle; the analysis which was originally made by him became in the\n",
      "next generation the foundation of further technical distinctions. Both\n",
      "in Plato and Aristotle we note the illusion under which the ancients\n",
      "fell of regarding the transience of pleasure as a proof of its\n",
      "unreality, and of confounding the permanence of the intellectual\n",
      "pleasures with the unchangeableness of the knowledge from which they are\n",
      "derived. Neither do we like to admit that the pleasures of knowledge,\n",
      "though more elevating, are not more lasting than other pleasures,\n",

      "2. The number of the interval which separates the king from the tyrant,\n",
      "and royal from tyrannical pleasures, is 729, the cube of 9. Which Plato\n",
      "characteristically designates as a number concerned with human life,\n",
      "because NEARLY equivalent to the number of days and nights in the\n",
      "year. He is desirous of proclaiming that the interval between them is\n",
      "immeasurable, and invents a formula to give expression to his idea.\n",
      "Those who spoke of justice as a cube, of virtue as an art of measuring\n",
      "(Prot.), saw no inappropriateness in conceiving the soul under the\n",
      "figure of a line, or the pleasure of the tyrant as separated from the\n",
      "pleasure of the king by the numerical interval of 729. And in modern\n",
      "times we sometimes use metaphorically what Plato employed as a\n",
      "philosophical formula. 'It is not easy to estimate the loss of the\n",
      "tyrant, except perhaps in this way,' says Plato. So we might say, that\n",
      "although the life of a good man is not to be compared to that of a bad\n",
      "man, yet you may measure the difference between them by valuing one\n",
      "minute of the one at an hour of the other ('One day in thy courts is\n",
      "better than a thousand'), or you might say that 'there is an infinite\n",
      "difference.' But this is not so much as saying, in homely phrase, 'They\n",
      "are a thousand miles asunder.' And accordingly Plato finds the natural\n",
      "vehicle of his thoughts in a progression of numbers; this arithmetical\n",
      "formula he draws out with the utmost seriousness, and both here and in\n",
      "the number of generation seems to find an additional proof of the truth\n",
      "of his speculation in forming the number into a geometrical figure; just\n",
      "as persons in our own day are apt to fancy that a statement is verified\n",
      "when it has been only thrown into an abstract form. In speaking of the\n",
      "number 729 as proper to human life, he probably intended to intimate\n",
      "that one year of the tyrannical = 12 hours of the royal life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The simple observation that the comparison of two similar solids\n",
      "is effected by the comparison of the cubes of their sides, is the\n",
      "mathematical groundwork of this fanciful expression. There is some\n",
      "difficulty in explaining the steps by which the number 729 is obtained;\n",
      "the oligarch is removed in the third degree from the royal and\n",
      "aristocratical, and the tyrant in the third degree from the\n",
      "oligarchical; but we have to arrange the terms as the sides of a square\n",
      "and to count the oligarch twice over, thus reckoning them not as = 5 but\n",

      "the 9th Book the pattern which is in heaven takes the place of the\n",
      "city of philosophers on earth. The vision which has received form and\n",

      "BOOK X. Many things pleased me in the order of our State, but there\n",
      "was nothing which I liked better than the regulation about poetry. The\n",
      "division of the soul throws a new light on our exclusion of imitation.\n",
      "I do not mind telling you in confidence that all poetry is an outrage on\n",
      "the understanding, unless the hearers have that balm of knowledge which\n",
      "heals error. I have loved Homer ever since I was a boy, and even now\n",
      "he appears to me to be the great master of tragic poetry. But much as\n",
      "I love the man, I love truth more, and therefore I must speak out: and\n",
      "first of all, will you explain what is imitation, for really I do not\n",
      "understand? 'How likely then that I should understand!' That might very\n",
      "well be, for the duller often sees better than the keener eye. 'True,\n",
      "but in your presence I can hardly venture to say what I think.'\n",
      "Then suppose that we begin in our old fashion, with the doctrine of\n",
      "universals. Let us assume the existence of beds and tables. There is one\n",
      "idea of a bed, or of a table, which the maker of each had in his mind\n",
      "when making them; he did not make the ideas of beds and tables, but he\n",
      "made beds and tables according to the ideas. And is there not a maker\n",
      "of the works of all workmen, who makes not only vessels but plants and\n",
      "animals, himself, the earth and heaven, and things in heaven and under\n",
      "the earth? He makes the Gods also. 'He must be a wizard indeed!' But do\n",
      "you not see that there is a sense in which you could do the same? You\n",
      "have only to take a mirror, and catch the reflection of the sun, and the\n",
      "earth, or anything else--there now you have made them. 'Yes, but only\n",
      "in appearance.' Exactly so; and the painter is such a creator as you are\n",
      "with the mirror, and he is even more unreal than the carpenter; although\n",
      "neither the carpenter nor any other artist can be supposed to make the\n",
      "absolute bed. 'Not if philosophers may be believed.' Nor need we wonder\n",
      "that his bed has but an imperfect relation to the truth. Reflect:--Here\n",
      "are three beds; one in nature, which is made by God; another, which is\n",
      "made by the carpenter; and the third, by the painter. God only made one,\n",
      "nor could he have made more than one; for if there had been two, there\n",
      "would always have been a third--more absolute and abstract than either,\n",
      "under which they would have been included. We may therefore conceive God\n",
      "to be the natural maker of the bed, and in a lower sense the carpenter\n",
      "is also the maker; but the painter is rather the imitator of what the\n",
      "other two make; he has to do with a creation which is thrice removed\n",
      "from reality. And the tragic poet is an imitator, and, like every\n",
      "other imitator, is thrice removed from the king and from the truth.\n",
      "The painter imitates not the original bed, but the bed made by the\n",
      "carpenter. And this, without being really different, appears to be\n",
      "different, and has many points of view, of which only one is caught by\n",
      "the painter, who represents everything because he represents a piece of\n",
      "everything, and that piece an image. And he can paint any other artist,\n",
      "although he knows nothing of their arts; and this with sufficient skill\n",
      "to deceive children or simple people. Suppose now that somebody came to\n",
      "us and told us, how he had met a man who knew all that everybody knows,\n",
      "and better than anybody:--should we not infer him to be a simpleton who,\n",
      "having no discernment of truth and falsehood, had met with a wizard\n",
      "or enchanter, whom he fancied to be all-wise? And when we hear persons\n",
      "saying that Homer and the tragedians know all the arts and all the\n",
      "virtues, must we not infer that they are under a similar delusion? they\n",
      "do not see that the poets are imitators, and that their creations are\n",
      "only imitations. 'Very true.' But if a person could create as well as\n",
      "imitate, he would rather leave some permanent work and not an imitation\n",
      "only; he would rather be the receiver than the giver of praise? 'Yes,\n",
      "for then he would have more honour and advantage.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us now interrogate Homer and the poets. Friend Homer, say I to him,\n",
      "I am not going to ask you about medicine, or any art to which your\n",
      "poems incidentally refer, but about their main subjects--war, military\n",
      "tactics, politics. If you are only twice and not thrice removed from the\n",
      "truth--not an imitator or an image-maker, please to inform us what good\n",
      "you have ever done to mankind? Is there any city which professes to have\n",
      "received laws from you, as Sicily and Italy have from Charondas, Sparta\n",
      "from Lycurgus, Athens from Solon? Or was any war ever carried on by your\n",
      "counsels? or is any invention attributed to you, as there is to Thales\n",
      "and Anacharsis? Or is there any Homeric way of life, such as the\n",
      "Pythagorean was, in which you instructed men, and which is called after\n",
      "you? 'No, indeed; and Creophylus (Flesh-child) was even more unfortunate\n",
      "in his breeding than he was in his name, if, as tradition says, Homer in\n",
      "his lifetime was allowed by him and his other friends to starve.' Yes,\n",
      "but could this ever have happened if Homer had really been the educator\n",
      "of Hellas? Would he not have had many devoted followers? If Protagoras\n",
      "and Prodicus can persuade their contemporaries that no one can manage\n",
      "house or State without them, is it likely that Homer and Hesiod would\n",
      "have been allowed to go about as beggars--I mean if they had really been\n",
      "able to do the world any good?--would not men have compelled them\n",
      "to stay where they were, or have followed them about in order to get\n",
      "education? But they did not; and therefore we may infer that Homer and\n",
      "all the poets are only imitators, who do but imitate the appearances of\n",
      "things. For as a painter by a knowledge of figure and colour can paint a\n",
      "cobbler without any practice in cobbling, so the poet can delineate\n",
      "any art in the colours of language, and give harmony and rhythm to the\n",
      "cobbler and also to the general; and you know how mere narration, when\n",
      "deprived of the ornaments of metre, is like a face which has lost the\n",
      "beauty of youth and never had any other. Once more, the imitator has no\n",
      "knowledge of reality, but only of appearance. The painter paints, and\n",
      "the artificer makes a bridle and reins, but neither understands the use\n",
      "of them--the knowledge of this is confined to the horseman; and so of\n",
      "other things. Thus we have three arts: one of use, another of invention,\n",
      "a third of imitation; and the user furnishes the rule to the two others.\n",
      "The flute-player will know the good and bad flute, and the maker\n",
      "will put faith in him; but the imitator will neither know nor have\n",
      "faith--neither science nor true opinion can be ascribed to him.\n",
      "Imitation, then, is devoid of knowledge, being only a kind of play\n",
      "or sport, and the tragic and epic poets are imitators in the highest\n",
      "degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now let us enquire, what is the faculty in man which answers to\n",
      "imitation. Allow me to explain my meaning: Objects are differently seen\n",
      "when in the water and when out of the water, when near and when at a\n",
      "distance; and the painter or juggler makes use of this variation to\n",
      "impose upon us. And the art of measuring and weighing and calculating\n",
      "comes in to save our bewildered minds from the power of appearance; for,\n",
      "as we were saying, two contrary opinions of the same about the same and\n",
      "at the same time, cannot both of them be true. But which of them is\n",
      "true is determined by the art of calculation; and this is allied to the\n",
      "better faculty in the soul, as the arts of imitation are to the worse.\n",
      "And the same holds of the ear as well as of the eye, of poetry as well\n",
      "as painting. The imitation is of actions voluntary or involuntary,\n",
      "in which there is an expectation of a good or bad result, and present\n",
      "experience of pleasure and pain. But is a man in harmony with himself\n",
      "when he is the subject of these conflicting influences? Is there not\n",
      "rather a contradiction in him? Let me further ask, whether he is more\n",
      "likely to control sorrow when he is alone or when he is in company.\n",
      "'In the latter case.' Feeling would lead him to indulge his sorrow, but\n",
      "reason and law control him and enjoin patience; since he cannot know\n",
      "whether his affliction is good or evil, and no human thing is of\n",
      "any great consequence, while sorrow is certainly a hindrance to good\n",
      "counsel. For when we stumble, we should not, like children, make an\n",
      "uproar; we should take the measures which reason prescribes, not raising\n",
      "a lament, but finding a cure. And the better part of us is ready to\n",
      "follow reason, while the irrational principle is full of sorrow and\n",
      "distraction at the recollection of our troubles. Unfortunately, however,\n",
      "this latter furnishes the chief materials of the imitative arts. Whereas\n",
      "reason is ever in repose and cannot easily be displayed, especially to a\n",
      "mixed multitude who have no experience of her. Thus the poet is like the\n",
      "painter in two ways: first he paints an inferior degree of truth, and\n",
      "secondly, he is concerned with an inferior part of the soul. He indulges\n",
      "the feelings, while he enfeebles the reason; and we refuse to allow him\n",
      "to have authority over the mind of man; for he has no measure of greater\n",
      "and less, and is a maker of images and very far gone from truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we have not yet mentioned the heaviest count in the indictment--the\n",
      "power which poetry has of injuriously exciting the feelings. When we\n",
      "hear some passage in which a hero laments his sufferings at tedious\n",
      "length, you know that we sympathize with him and praise the poet; and\n",
      "yet in our own sorrows such an exhibition of feeling is regarded as\n",
      "effeminate and unmanly (Ion). Now, ought a man to feel pleasure in\n",
      "seeing another do what he hates and abominates in himself? Is he not\n",
      "giving way to a sentiment which in his own case he would control?--he is\n",
      "off his guard because the sorrow is another's; and he thinks that he\n",
      "may indulge his feelings without disgrace, and will be the gainer by\n",
      "the pleasure. But the inevitable consequence is that he who begins by\n",
      "weeping at the sorrows of others, will end by weeping at his own. The\n",
      "same is true of comedy,--you may often laugh at buffoonery which you\n",
      "would be ashamed to utter, and the love of coarse merriment on the stage\n",
      "will at last turn you into a buffoon at home. Poetry feeds and waters\n",
      "the passions and desires; she lets them rule instead of ruling them. And\n",
      "therefore, when we hear the encomiasts of Homer affirming that he is\n",
      "the educator of Hellas, and that all life should be regulated by his\n",
      "precepts, we may allow the excellence of their intentions, and agree\n",
      "with them in thinking Homer a great poet and tragedian. But we shall\n",
      "continue to prohibit all poetry which goes beyond hymns to the Gods and\n",
      "praises of famous men. Not pleasure and pain, but law and reason shall\n",
      "rule in our State.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are our grounds for expelling poetry; but lest she should charge\n",
      "us with discourtesy, let us also make an apology to her. We will remind\n",
      "her that there is an ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy, of\n",
      "which there are many traces in the writings of the poets, such as the\n",
      "saying of 'the she-dog, yelping at her mistress,' and 'the philosophers\n",
      "who are ready to circumvent Zeus,' and 'the philosophers who are\n",
      "paupers.' Nevertheless we bear her no ill-will, and will gladly allow\n",
      "her to return upon condition that she makes a defence of herself in\n",
      "verse; and her supporters who are not poets may speak in prose. We\n",
      "confess her charms; but if she cannot show that she is useful as well\n",
      "as delightful, like rational lovers, we must renounce our love,\n",
      "though endeared to us by early associations. Having come to years of\n",
      "discretion, we know that poetry is not truth, and that a man should be\n",
      "careful how he introduces her to that state or constitution which he\n",
      "himself is; for there is a mighty issue at stake--no less than the good\n",
      "or evil of a human soul. And it is not worth while to forsake justice\n",
      "and virtue for the attractions of poetry, any more than for the sake of\n",
      "honour or wealth. 'I agree with you.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet the rewards of virtue are greater far than I have described.\n",
      "'And can we conceive things greater still?' Not, perhaps, in this brief\n",
      "span of life: but should an immortal being care about anything short of\n",
      "eternity? 'I do not understand what you mean?' Do you not know that the\n",
      "soul is immortal? 'Surely you are not prepared to prove that?' Indeed I\n",
      "am. 'Then let me hear this argument, of which you make so light.'\n",
      "\n",
      "You would admit that everything has an element of good and of evil. In\n",
      "all things there is an inherent corruption; and if this cannot destroy\n",
      "them, nothing else will. The soul too has her own corrupting principles,\n",
      "which are injustice, intemperance, cowardice, and the like. But none of\n",
      "these destroy the soul in the same sense that disease destroys the body.\n",
      "The soul may be full of all iniquities, but is not, by reason of them,\n",
      "brought any nearer to death. Nothing which was not destroyed from within\n",
      "ever perished by external affection of evil. The body, which is one\n",
      "thing, cannot be destroyed by food, which is another, unless the badness\n",
      "of the food is communicated to the body. Neither can the soul, which\n",
      "is one thing, be corrupted by the body, which is another, unless she\n",

      "can any bodily evil, whether disease or violence, or any other destroy\n",
      "the soul, unless it can be shown to render her unholy and unjust. But no\n",
      "one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust when\n",
      "they die. If a person has the audacity to say the contrary, the answer\n",
      "is--Then why do criminals require the hand of the executioner, and\n",
      "not die of themselves? 'Truly,' he said, 'injustice would not be very\n",
      "terrible if it brought a cessation of evil; but I rather believe that\n",
      "the injustice which murders others may tend to quicken and stimulate\n",
      "the life of the unjust.' You are quite right. If sin which is her own\n",
      "natural and inherent evil cannot destroy the soul, hardly will anything\n",
      "else destroy her. But the soul which cannot be destroyed either by\n",
      "internal or external evil must be immortal and everlasting. And if\n",
      "this be true, souls will always exist in the same number. They cannot\n",
      "diminish, because they cannot be destroyed; nor yet increase, for the\n",
      "increase of the immortal must come from something mortal, and so all\n",
      "would end in immortality. Neither is the soul variable and diverse; for\n",
      "that which is immortal must be of the fairest and simplest composition.\n",
      "If we would conceive her truly, and so behold justice and injustice in\n",
      "their own nature, she must be viewed by the light of reason pure as at\n",
      "birth, or as she is reflected in philosophy when holding converse with\n",
      "the divine and immortal and eternal. In her present condition we see her\n",
      "only like the sea-god Glaucus, bruised and maimed in the sea which is\n",

      "herself, even if a man should put on a Gyges' ring and have the helmet\n",
      "of Hades too. And now you shall repay me what you borrowed; and I will\n",
      "enumerate the rewards of justice in life and after death. I granted,\n",
      "for the sake of argument, as you will remember, that evil might\n",
      "perhaps escape the knowledge of Gods and men, although this was really\n",
      "impossible. And since I have shown that justice has reality, you must\n",
      "grant me also that she has the palm of appearance. In the first place,\n",
      "the just man is known to the Gods, and he is therefore the friend of the\n",
      "Gods, and he will receive at their hands every good, always excepting\n",
      "such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins. All things end\n",
      "in good to him, either in life or after death, even what appears to\n",
      "be evil; for the Gods have a care of him who desires to be in their\n",
      "likeness. And what shall we say of men? Is not honesty the best policy?\n",
      "The clever rogue makes a great start at first, but breaks down before he\n",
      "reaches the goal, and slinks away in dishonour; whereas the true runner\n",
      "perseveres to the end, and receives the prize. And you must allow me\n",
      "to repeat all the blessings which you attributed to the fortunate\n",
      "unjust--they bear rule in the city, they marry and give in marriage to\n",
      "whom they will; and the evils which you attributed to the unfortunate\n",
      "just, do really fall in the end on the unjust, although, as you implied,\n",
      "their sufferings are better veiled in silence.\n",
      "\n",

      "with those which await good men after death. 'I should like to hear\n",
      "about them.' Come, then, and I will tell you the story of Er, the son of\n",
      "Armenius, a valiant man. He was supposed to have died in battle, but ten\n",
      "days afterwards his body was found untouched by corruption and sent home\n",
      "for burial. On the twelfth day he was placed on the funeral pyre and\n",
      "there he came to life again, and told what he had seen in the world\n",
      "below. He said that his soul went with a great company to a place, in\n",
      "which there were two chasms near together in the earth beneath, and two\n",
      "corresponding chasms in the heaven above. And there were judges sitting\n",
      "in the intermediate space, bidding the just ascend by the heavenly\n",
      "way on the right hand, having the seal of their judgment set upon them\n",
      "before, while the unjust, having the seal behind, were bidden to descend\n",
      "by the way on the left hand. Him they told to look and listen, as he was\n",
      "to be their messenger to men from the world below. And he beheld and saw\n",
      "the souls departing after judgment at either chasm; some who came from\n",
      "earth, were worn and travel-stained; others, who came from heaven,\n",
      "were clean and bright. They seemed glad to meet and rest awhile in the\n",
      "meadow; here they discoursed with one another of what they had seen in\n",
      "the other world. Those who came from earth wept at the remembrance of\n",
      "their sorrows, but the spirits from above spoke of glorious sights and\n",
      "heavenly bliss. He said that for every evil deed they were punished\n",
      "tenfold--now the journey was of a thousand years' duration, because the\n",
      "life of man was reckoned as a hundred years--and the rewards of virtue\n",
      "were in the same proportion. He added something hardly worth repeating\n",
      "about infants dying almost as soon as they were born. Of parricides and\n",
      "other murderers he had tortures still more terrible to narrate. He was\n",
      "present when one of the spirits asked--Where is Ardiaeus the Great?\n",
      "(This Ardiaeus was a cruel tyrant, who had murdered his father, and his\n",
      "elder brother, a thousand years before.) Another spirit answered,\n",
      "'He comes not hither, and will never come. And I myself,' he added,\n",
      "'actually saw this terrible sight. At the entrance of the chasm, as we\n",
      "were about to reascend, Ardiaeus appeared, and some other sinners--most\n",
      "of whom had been tyrants, but not all--and just as they fancied that\n",
      "they were returning to life, the chasm gave a roar, and then wild,\n",
      "fiery-looking men who knew the meaning of the sound, seized him and\n",
      "several others, and bound them hand and foot and threw them down, and\n",
      "dragged them along at the side of the road, lacerating them and carding\n",
      "them like wool, and explaining to the passers-by, that they were going\n",
      "to be cast into hell.' The greatest terror of the pilgrims ascending was\n",
      "lest they should hear the voice, and when there was silence one by one\n",
      "they passed up with joy. To these sufferings there were corresponding\n",
      "delights.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the eighth day the souls of the pilgrims resumed their journey,\n",
      "and in four days came to a spot whence they looked down upon a line of\n",
      "light, in colour like a rainbow, only brighter and clearer. One day\n",
      "more brought them to the place, and they saw that this was the column\n",
      "of light which binds together the whole universe. The ends of the column\n",
      "were fastened to heaven, and from them hung the distaff of Necessity,\n",
      "on which all the heavenly bodies turned--the hook and spindle were of\n",
      "adamant, and the whorl of a mixed substance. The whorl was in form\n",
      "like a number of boxes fitting into one another with their edges\n",
      "turned upwards, making together a single whorl which was pierced by the\n",
      "spindle. The outermost had the rim broadest, and the inner whorls were\n",
      "smaller and smaller, and had their rims narrower. The largest (the fixed\n",
      "stars) was spangled--the seventh (the sun) was brightest--the eighth\n",
      "(the moon) shone by the light of the seventh--the second and fifth\n",
      "(Saturn and Mercury) were most like one another and yellower than the\n",
      "eighth--the third (Jupiter) had the whitest light--the fourth (Mars)\n",
      "was red--the sixth (Venus) was in whiteness second. The whole had one\n",
      "motion, but while this was revolving in one direction the seven inner\n",
      "circles were moving in the opposite, with various degrees of swiftness\n",
      "and slowness. The spindle turned on the knees of Necessity, and a Siren\n",
      "stood hymning upon each circle, while Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos, the\n",
      "daughters of Necessity, sat on thrones at equal intervals, singing of\n",
      "past, present, and future, responsive to the music of the Sirens; Clotho\n",
      "from time to time guiding the outer circle with a touch of her right\n",
      "hand; Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner circles;\n",
      "Lachesis in turn putting forth her hand from time to time to guide both\n",
      "of them. On their arrival the pilgrims went to Lachesis, and there was\n",
      "an interpreter who arranged them, and taking from her knees lots, and\n",
      "samples of lives, got up into a pulpit and said: 'Mortal souls, hear\n",
      "the words of Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity. A new period of\n",
      "mortal life has begun, and you may choose what divinity you please;\n",
      "the responsibility of choosing is with you--God is blameless.' After\n",
      "speaking thus, he cast the lots among them and each one took up the\n",
      "lot which fell near him. He then placed on the ground before them the\n",
      "samples of lives, many more than the souls present; and there were all\n",
      "sorts of lives, of men and of animals. There were tyrannies ending in\n",
      "misery and exile, and lives of men and women famous for their different\n",
      "qualities; and also mixed lives, made up of wealth and poverty,\n",
      "sickness and health. Here, Glaucon, is the great risk of human life, and\n",
      "therefore the whole of education should be directed to the acquisition\n",
      "of such a knowledge as will teach a man to refuse the evil and choose\n",
      "the good. He should know all the combinations which occur in life--of\n",
      "beauty with poverty or with wealth,--of knowledge with external\n",
      "goods,--and at last choose with reference to the nature of the soul,\n",
      "regarding that only as the better life which makes men better, and\n",
      "leaving the rest. And a man must take with him an iron sense of truth\n",
      "and right into the world below, that there too he may remain undazzled\n",
      "by wealth or the allurements of evil, and be determined to avoid the\n",
      "extremes and choose the mean. For this, as the messenger reported the\n",
      "interpreter to have said, is the true happiness of man; and any one, as\n",
      "he proclaimed, may, if he choose with understanding, have a good lot,\n",
      "even though he come last. 'Let not the first be careless in his choice,\n",
      "nor the last despair.' He spoke; and when he had spoken, he who had\n",
      "drawn the first lot chose a tyranny: he did not see that he was fated to\n",
      "devour his own children--and when he discovered his mistake, he wept\n",
      "and beat his breast, blaming chance and the Gods and anybody rather\n",
      "than himself. He was one of those who had come from heaven, and in his\n",
      "previous life had been a citizen of a well-ordered State, but he had\n",
      "only habit and no philosophy. Like many another, he made a bad choice,\n",
      "because he had no experience of life; whereas those who came from earth\n",
      "and had seen trouble were not in such a hurry to choose. But if a\n",
      "man had followed philosophy while upon earth, and had been moderately\n",
      "fortunate in his lot, he might not only be happy here, but his\n",
      "pilgrimage both from and to this world would be smooth and heavenly.\n",
      "Nothing was more curious than the spectacle of the choice, at once sad\n",
      "and laughable and wonderful; most of the souls only seeking to avoid\n",
      "their own condition in a previous life. He saw the soul of Orpheus\n",
      "changing into a swan because he would not be born of a woman; there was\n",
      "Thamyras becoming a nightingale; musical birds, like the swan, choosing\n",
      "to be men; the twentieth soul, which was that of Ajax, preferring the\n",
      "life of a lion to that of a man, in remembrance of the injustice which\n",
      "was done to him in the judgment of the arms; and Agamemnon, from a like\n",
      "enmity to human nature, passing into an eagle. About the middle was the\n",
      "soul of Atalanta choosing the honours of an athlete, and next to her\n",
      "Epeus taking the nature of a workwoman; among the last was Thersites,\n",
      "who was changing himself into a monkey. Thither, the last of all, came\n",
      "Odysseus, and sought the lot of a private man, which lay neglected and\n",
      "despised, and when he found it he went away rejoicing, and said that if\n",
      "he had been first instead of last, his choice would have been the same.\n",
      "Men, too, were seen passing into animals, and wild and tame animals\n",
      "changing into one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "When all the souls had chosen they went to Lachesis, who sent with each\n",
      "of them their genius or attendant to fulfil their lot. He first of\n",
      "all brought them under the hand of Clotho, and drew them within the\n",
      "revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand; from her they were\n",
      "carried to Atropos, who made the threads irreversible; whence, without\n",
      "turning round, they passed beneath the throne of Necessity; and when\n",
      "they had all passed, they moved on in scorching heat to the plain of\n",
      "Forgetfulness and rested at evening by the river Unmindful, whose water\n",
      "could not be retained in any vessel; of this they had all to drink a\n",
      "certain quantity--some of them drank more than was required, and he who\n",
      "drank forgot all things. Er himself was prevented from drinking.\n",
      "When they had gone to rest, about the middle of the night there were\n",
      "thunderstorms and earthquakes, and suddenly they were all driven divers\n",
      "ways, shooting like stars to their birth. Concerning his return to the\n",

      "of Forgetfulness, and be dear to ourselves and to the Gods, and have\n",

      "The Tenth Book of the Republic of Plato falls into two divisions: first,\n",

      "seen to be very far gone from the truth; and secondly, having shown the\n",
      "reality of the happiness of the just, he demands that appearance shall\n",
      "be restored to him, and then proceeds to prove the immortality of the\n",
      "soul. The argument, as in the Phaedo and Gorgias, is supplemented by the\n",
      "vision of a future life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why Plato, who was himself a poet, and whose dialogues are poems and\n",
      "dramas, should have been hostile to the poets as a class, and especially\n",
      "to the dramatic poets; why he should not have seen that truth may\n",
      "be embodied in verse as well as in prose, and that there are some\n",
      "indefinable lights and shadows of human life which can only be expressed\n",
      "in poetry--some elements of imagination which always entwine with\n",
      "reason; why he should have supposed epic verse to be inseparably\n",
      "associated with the impurities of the old Hellenic mythology; why\n",
      "he should try Homer and Hesiod by the unfair and prosaic test of\n",
      "utility,--are questions which have always been debated amongst students\n",
      "of Plato. Though unable to give a complete answer to them, we may\n",
      "show--first, that his views arose naturally out of the circumstances\n",
      "of his age; and secondly, we may elicit the truth as well as the error\n",
      "which is contained in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is the enemy of the poets because poetry was declining in his own\n",
      "lifetime, and a theatrocracy, as he says in the Laws, had taken the\n",
      "place of an intellectual aristocracy. Euripides exhibited the last phase\n",
      "of the tragic drama, and in him Plato saw the friend and apologist of\n",
      "tyrants, and the Sophist of tragedy. The old comedy was almost extinct;\n",
      "the new had not yet arisen. Dramatic and lyric poetry, like every other\n",
      "branch of Greek literature, was falling under the power of rhetoric.\n",
      "There was no 'second or third' to Aeschylus and Sophocles in the\n",
      "generation which followed them. Aristophanes, in one of his later\n",
      "comedies (Frogs), speaks of 'thousands of tragedy-making prattlers,'\n",

      "garrulity went far beyond Euripides,'--'they appeared once upon the\n",
      "stage, and there was an end of them.' To a man of genius who had a\n",
      "real appreciation of the godlike Aeschylus and the noble and gentle\n",
      "Sophocles, though disagreeing with some parts of their 'theology'\n",
      "(Rep.), these 'minor poets' must have been contemptible and intolerable.\n",
      "There is no feeling stronger in the dialogues of Plato than a sense of\n",
      "the decline and decay both in literature and in politics which marked\n",
      "his own age. Nor can he have been expected to look with favour on the\n",
      "licence of Aristophanes, now at the end of his career, who had begun by\n",
      "satirizing Socrates in the Clouds, and in a similar spirit forty years\n",
      "afterwards had satirized the founders of ideal commonwealths in his\n",
      "Eccleziazusae, or Female Parliament (Laws).\n",
      "\n",
      "There were other reasons for the antagonism of Plato to poetry. The\n",
      "profession of an actor was regarded by him as a degradation of human\n",
      "nature, for 'one man in his life' cannot 'play many parts;' the\n",
      "characters which the actor performs seem to destroy his own character,\n",
      "and to leave nothing which can be truly called himself. Neither can any\n",
      "man live his life and act it. The actor is the slave of his art, not the\n",
      "master of it. Taking this view Plato is more decided in his expulsion of\n",
      "the dramatic than of the epic poets, though he must have known that\n",
      "the Greek tragedians afforded noble lessons and examples of virtue\n",
      "and patriotism, to which nothing in Homer can be compared. But great\n",
      "dramatic or even great rhetorical power is hardly consistent with\n",
      "firmness or strength of mind, and dramatic talent is often incidentally\n",
      "associated with a weak or dissolute character.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Tenth Book Plato introduces a new series of objections. First,\n",
      "he says that the poet or painter is an imitator, and in the third\n",
      "degree removed from the truth. His creations are not tested by rule and\n",
      "measure; they are only appearances. In modern times we should say that\n",
      "art is not merely imitation, but rather the expression of the ideal in\n",
      "forms of sense. Even adopting the humble image of Plato, from which\n",
      "his argument derives a colour, we should maintain that the artist may\n",
      "ennoble the bed which he paints by the folds of the drapery, or by the\n",
      "feeling of home which he introduces; and there have been modern\n",
      "painters who have imparted such an ideal interest to a blacksmith's or\n",
      "a carpenter's shop. The eye or mind which feels as well as sees can give\n",
      "dignity and pathos to a ruined mill, or a straw-built shed (Rembrandt),\n",
      "to the hull of a vessel 'going to its last home' (Turner). Still more\n",
      "would this apply to the greatest works of art, which seem to be the\n",
      "visible embodiment of the divine. Had Plato been asked whether the Zeus\n",
      "or Athene of Pheidias was the imitation of an imitation only, would he\n",
      "not have been compelled to admit that something more was to be found in\n",
      "them than in the form of any mortal; and that the rule of proportion\n",
      "to which they conformed was 'higher far than any geometry or arithmetic\n",
      "could express?' (Statesman.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, Plato objects to the imitative arts that they express the\n",
      "emotional rather than the rational part of human nature. He does not\n",
      "admit Aristotle's theory, that tragedy or other serious imitations are\n",
      "a purgation of the passions by pity and fear; to him they appear only to\n",
      "afford the opportunity of indulging them. Yet we must acknowledge that\n",
      "we may sometimes cure disordered emotions by giving expression to them;\n",
      "and that they often gain strength when pent up within our own breast.\n",
      "It is not every indulgence of the feelings which is to be condemned.\n",
      "For there may be a gratification of the higher as well as of the\n",
      "lower--thoughts which are too deep or too sad to be expressed by\n",
      "ourselves, may find an utterance in the words of poets. Every one would\n",
      "acknowledge that there have been times when they were consoled and\n",
      "elevated by beautiful music or by the sublimity of architecture or by\n",
      "the peacefulness of nature. Plato has himself admitted, in the earlier\n",
      "part of the Republic, that the arts might have the effect of harmonizing\n",
      "as well as of enervating the mind; but in the Tenth Book he regards them\n",
      "through a Stoic or Puritan medium. He asks only 'What good have they\n",
      "done?' and is not satisfied with the reply, that 'They have given\n",
      "innocent pleasure to mankind.'\n",
      "\n",
      "He tells us that he rejoices in the banishment of the poets, since he\n",
      "has found by the analysis of the soul that they are concerned with the\n",
      "inferior faculties. He means to say that the higher faculties have to do\n",
      "with universals, the lower with particulars of sense. The poets are on\n",
      "a level with their own age, but not on a level with Socrates and Plato;\n",
      "and he was well aware that Homer and Hesiod could not be made a rule of\n",
      "life by any process of legitimate interpretation; his ironical use of\n",
      "them is in fact a denial of their authority; he saw, too, that the\n",
      "poets were not critics--as he says in the Apology, 'Any one was a better\n",
      "interpreter of their writings than they were themselves. He himself\n",
      "ceased to be a poet when he became a disciple of Socrates; though, as he\n",
      "tells us of Solon, 'he might have been one of the greatest of them, if\n",
      "he had not been deterred by other pursuits' (Tim.) Thus from many points\n",
      "of view there is an antagonism between Plato and the poets, which was\n",
      "foreshadowed to him in the old quarrel between philosophy and poetry.\n",
      "The poets, as he says in the Protagoras, were the Sophists of their day;\n",
      "and his dislike of the one class is reflected on the other. He regards\n",
      "them both as the enemies of reasoning and abstraction, though in the\n",
      "case of Euripides more with reference to his immoral sentiments about\n",
      "tyrants and the like. For Plato is the prophet who 'came into the world\n",
      "to convince men'--first of the fallibility of sense and opinion, and\n",
      "secondly of the reality of abstract ideas. Whatever strangeness there\n",

      "1. Plato expressly says that he is intending to found an Hellenic State\n",
      "(Book V). Many of his regulations are characteristically Spartan; such\n",
      "as the prohibition of gold and silver, the common meals of the men, the\n",
      "military training of the youth, the gymnastic exercises of the women.\n",
      "The life of Sparta was the life of a camp (Laws), enforced even more\n",
      "rigidly in time of peace than in war; the citizens of Sparta, like\n",
      "Plato's, were forbidden to trade--they were to be soldiers and not\n",
      "shopkeepers. Nowhere else in Greece was the individual so completely\n",
      "subjected to the State; the time when he was to marry, the education of\n",
      "his children, the clothes which he was to wear, the food which he was\n",
      "to eat, were all prescribed by law. Some of the best enactments in the\n",
      "Republic, such as the reverence to be paid to parents and elders,\n",
      "and some of the worst, such as the exposure of deformed children, are\n",
      "borrowed from the practice of Sparta. The encouragement of friendships\n",
      "between men and youths, or of men with one another, as affording\n",
      "incentives to bravery, is also Spartan; in Sparta too a nearer approach\n",
      "was made than in any other Greek State to equality of the sexes, and\n",
      "to community of property; and while there was probably less of\n",
      "licentiousness in the sense of immorality, the tie of marriage was\n",
      "regarded more lightly than in the rest of Greece. The 'suprema lex'\n",
      "was the preservation of the family, and the interest of the State. The\n",
      "coarse strength of a military government was not favourable to purity\n",
      "and refinement; and the excessive strictness of some regulations seems\n",
      "to have produced a reaction. Of all Hellenes the Spartans were most\n",
      "accessible to bribery; several of the greatest of them might be\n",
      "described in the words of Plato as having a 'fierce secret longing\n",
      "after gold and silver.' Though not in the strict sense communists, the\n",
      "principle of communism was maintained among them in their division of\n",
      "lands, in their common meals, in their slaves, and in the free use of\n",
      "one another's goods. Marriage was a public institution: and the women\n",
      "were educated by the State, and sang and danced in public with the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many traditions were preserved at Sparta of the severity with which the\n",
      "magistrates had maintained the primitive rule of music and poetry; as in\n",
      "the Republic of Plato, the new-fangled poet was to be expelled. Hymns\n",
      "to the Gods, which are the only kind of music admitted into the ideal\n",
      "State, were the only kind which was permitted at Sparta. The Spartans,\n",
      "though an unpoetical race, were nevertheless lovers of poetry; they had\n",
      "been stirred by the Elegiac strains of Tyrtaeus, they had crowded around\n",
      "Hippias to hear his recitals of Homer; but in this they resembled the\n",
      "citizens of the timocratic rather than of the ideal State. The council\n",
      "of elder men also corresponds to the Spartan gerousia; and the freedom\n",
      "with which they are permitted to judge about matters of detail agrees\n",
      "with what we are told of that institution. Once more, the military rule\n",
      "of not spoiling the dead or offering arms at the temples; the moderation\n",
      "in the pursuit of enemies; the importance attached to the physical\n",
      "well-being of the citizens; the use of warfare for the sake of defence\n",
      "rather than of aggression--are features probably suggested by the spirit\n",
      "and practice of Sparta.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the Spartan type the ideal State reverts in the first decline; and\n",
      "the character of the individual timocrat is borrowed from the Spartan\n",
      "citizen. The love of Lacedaemon not only affected Plato and Xenophon,\n",
      "but was shared by many undistinguished Athenians; there they seemed to\n",
      "find a principle which was wanting in their own democracy. The (Greek)\n",
      "of the Spartans attracted them, that is to say, not the goodness\n",
      "of their laws, but the spirit of order and loyalty which prevailed.\n",
      "Fascinated by the idea, citizens of Athens would imitate the\n",
      "Lacedaemonians in their dress and manners; they were known to the\n",
      "contemporaries of Plato as 'the persons who had their ears bruised,'\n",
      "like the Roundheads of the Commonwealth. The love of another church\n",
      "or country when seen at a distance only, the longing for an imaginary\n",
      "simplicity in civilized times, the fond desire of a past which never has\n",
      "been, or of a future which never will be,--these are aspirations of the\n",
      "human mind which are often felt among ourselves. Such feelings meet with\n",
      "a response in the Republic of Plato.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there are other features of the Platonic Republic, as, for example,\n",
      "the literary and philosophical education, and the grace and beauty\n",
      "of life, which are the reverse of Spartan. Plato wishes to give his\n",
      "citizens a taste of Athenian freedom as well as of Lacedaemonian\n",
      "discipline. His individual genius is purely Athenian, although in theory\n",
      "he is a lover of Sparta; and he is something more than either--he has\n",
      "also a true Hellenic feeling. He is desirous of humanizing the wars of\n",
      "Hellenes against one another; he acknowledges that the Delphian God is\n",
      "the grand hereditary interpreter of all Hellas. The spirit of harmony\n",
      "and the Dorian mode are to prevail, and the whole State is to have an\n",
      "external beauty which is the reflex of the harmony within. But he\n",
      "has not yet found out the truth which he afterwards enunciated in the\n",
      "Laws--that he was a better legislator who made men to be of one mind,\n",
      "than he who trained them for war. The citizens, as in other Hellenic\n",
      "States, democratic as well as aristocratic, are really an upper class;\n",
      "for, although no mention is made of slaves, the lower classes are\n",
      "allowed to fade away into the distance, and are represented in the\n",
      "individual by the passions. Plato has no idea either of a social State\n",
      "in which all classes are harmonized, or of a federation of Hellas or\n",
      "the world in which different nations or States have a place. His city\n",
      "is equipped for war rather than for peace, and this would seem to be\n",
      "justified by the ordinary condition of Hellenic States. The myth of the\n",
      "earth-born men is an embodiment of the orthodox tradition of Hellas,\n",
      "and the allusion to the four ages of the world is also sanctioned by\n",
      "the authority of Hesiod and the poets. Thus we see that the Republic is\n",
      "partly founded on the ideal of the old Greek polis, partly on the actual\n",
      "circumstances of Hellas in that age. Plato, like the old painters,\n",
      "retains the traditional form, and like them he has also a vision of a\n",
      "city in the clouds.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is yet another thread which is interwoven in the texture of the\n",
      "work; for the Republic is not only a Dorian State, but a Pythagorean\n",
      "league. The 'way of life' which was connected with the name of\n",
      "Pythagoras, like the Catholic monastic orders, showed the power which\n",
      "the mind of an individual might exercise over his contemporaries, and\n",
      "may have naturally suggested to Plato the possibility of reviving such\n",
      "'mediaeval institutions.' The Pythagoreans, like Plato, enforced a rule\n",
      "of life and a moral and intellectual training. The influence ascribed to\n",
      "music, which to us seems exaggerated, is also a Pythagorean feature; it\n",
      "is not to be regarded as representing the real influence of music in\n",
      "the Greek world. More nearly than any other government of Hellas, the\n",
      "Pythagorean league of three hundred was an aristocracy of virtue. For\n",
      "once in the history of mankind the philosophy of order or (Greek),\n",
      "expressing and consequently enlisting on its side the combined\n",
      "endeavours of the better part of the people, obtained the management of\n",
      "public affairs and held possession of it for a considerable time (until\n",
      "about B.C. 500). Probably only in States prepared by Dorian institutions\n",
      "would such a league have been possible. The rulers, like Plato's\n",
      "(Greek), were required to submit to a severe training in order to\n",
      "prepare the way for the education of the other members of the community.\n",
      "Long after the dissolution of the Order, eminent Pythagoreans, such as\n",
      "Archytas of Tarentum, retained their political influence over the cities\n",
      "of Magna Graecia. There was much here that was suggestive to the kindred\n",
      "spirit of Plato, who had doubtless meditated deeply on the 'way of life\n",
      "of Pythagoras' (Rep.) and his followers. Slight traces of Pythagoreanism\n",
      "are to be found in the mystical number of the State, in the number which\n",
      "expresses the interval between the king and the tyrant, in the doctrine\n",
      "of transmigration, in the music of the spheres, as well as in the great\n",
      "though secondary importance ascribed to mathematics in education.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as in his philosophy, so also in the form of his State, he goes far\n",
      "beyond the old Pythagoreans. He attempts a task really impossible, which\n",
      "is to unite the past of Greek history with the future of philosophy,\n",
      "analogous to that other impossibility, which has often been the dream\n",
      "of Christendom, the attempt to unite the past history of Europe with\n",
      "the kingdom of Christ. Nothing actually existing in the world at all\n",
      "resembles Plato's ideal State; nor does he himself imagine that such\n",
      "a State is possible. This he repeats again and again; e.g. in the\n",
      "Republic, or in the Laws where, casting a glance back on the Republic,\n",
      "he admits that the perfect state of communism and philosophy was\n",
      "impossible in his own age, though still to be retained as a pattern.\n",
      "The same doubt is implied in the earnestness with which he argues in the\n",
      "Republic that ideals are none the worse because they cannot be realized\n",
      "in fact, and in the chorus of laughter, which like a breaking wave will,\n",
      "as he anticipates, greet the mention of his proposals; though like\n",
      "other writers of fiction, he uses all his art to give reality to his\n",
      "inventions. When asked how the ideal polity can come into being, he\n",
      "answers ironically, 'When one son of a king becomes a philosopher'; he\n",
      "designates the fiction of the earth-born men as 'a noble lie'; and when\n",
      "the structure is finally complete, he fairly tells you that his Republic\n",
      "is a vision only, which in some sense may have reality, but not in the\n",
      "vulgar one of a reign of philosophers upon earth. It has been said that\n",
      "Plato flies as well as walks, but this falls short of the truth; for he\n",
      "flies and walks at the same time, and is in the air and on firm ground\n",
      "in successive instants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Niebuhr has asked a trifling question, which may be briefly noticed in\n",
      "this place--Was Plato a good citizen? If by this is meant, Was he loyal\n",
      "to Athenian institutions?--he can hardly be said to be the friend of\n",
      "democracy: but neither is he the friend of any other existing form of\n",
      "government; all of them he regarded as 'states of faction' (Laws); none\n",
      "attained to his ideal of a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects, which\n",
      "seems indeed more nearly to describe democracy than any other; and the\n",
      "worst of them is tyranny. The truth is, that the question has hardly any\n",
      "meaning when applied to a great philosopher whose writings are not meant\n",
      "for a particular age and country, but for all time and all mankind. The\n",
      "decline of Athenian politics was probably the motive which led Plato to\n",
      "frame an ideal State, and the Republic may be regarded as reflecting the\n",
      "departing glory of Hellas. As well might we complain of St. Augustine,\n",
      "whose great work 'The City of God' originated in a similar motive, for\n",
      "not being loyal to the Roman Empire. Even a nearer parallel might be\n",
      "afforded by the first Christians, who cannot fairly be charged with\n",
      "being bad citizens because, though 'subject to the higher powers,' they\n",
      "were looking forward to a city which is in heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The idea of the perfect State is full of paradox when judged of\n",
      "according to the ordinary notions of mankind. The paradoxes of one age\n",
      "have been said to become the commonplaces of the next; but the\n",
      "paradoxes of Plato are at least as paradoxical to us as they were to his\n",
      "contemporaries. The modern world has either sneered at them as absurd,\n",
      "or denounced them as unnatural and immoral; men have been pleased to\n",
      "find in Aristotle's criticisms of them the anticipation of their own\n",
      "good sense. The wealthy and cultivated classes have disliked and also\n",
      "dreaded them; they have pointed with satisfaction to the failure of\n",
      "efforts to realize them in practice. Yet since they are the thoughts of\n",
      "one of the greatest of human intelligences, and of one who had done\n",
      "most to elevate morality and religion, they seem to deserve a better\n",
      "treatment at our hands. We may have to address the public, as Plato does\n",
      "poetry, and assure them that we mean no harm to existing institutions.\n",
      "There are serious errors which have a side of truth and which therefore\n",
      "may fairly demand a careful consideration: there are truths mixed with\n",
      "error of which we may indeed say, 'The half is better than the whole.'\n",
      "Yet 'the half' may be an important contribution to the study of human\n",
      "nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) The first paradox is the community of goods, which is mentioned\n",
      "slightly at the end of the third Book, and seemingly, as Aristotle\n",
      "observes, is confined to the guardians; at least no mention is made of\n",
      "the other classes. But the omission is not of any real significance, and\n",
      "probably arises out of the plan of the work, which prevents the writer\n",
      "from entering into details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aristotle censures the community of property much in the spirit of\n",
      "modern political economy, as tending to repress industry, and as doing\n",
      "away with the spirit of benevolence. Modern writers almost refuse to\n",
      "consider the subject, which is supposed to have been long ago settled\n",
      "by the common opinion of mankind. But it must be remembered that the\n",
      "sacredness of property is a notion far more fixed in modern than\n",
      "in ancient times. The world has grown older, and is therefore more\n",
      "conservative. Primitive society offered many examples of land held in\n",
      "common, either by a tribe or by a township, and such may probably\n",
      "have been the original form of landed tenure. Ancient legislators had\n",
      "invented various modes of dividing and preserving the divisions of land\n",
      "among the citizens; according to Aristotle there were nations who held\n",
      "the land in common and divided the produce, and there were others who\n",
      "divided the land and stored the produce in common. The evils of debt and\n",
      "the inequality of property were far greater in ancient than in modern\n",
      "times, and the accidents to which property was subject from war, or\n",
      "revolution, or taxation, or other legislative interference, were also\n",
      "greater. All these circumstances gave property a less fixed and sacred\n",
      "character. The early Christians are believed to have held their property\n",
      "in common, and the principle is sanctioned by the words of Christ\n",
      "himself, and has been maintained as a counsel of perfection in almost\n",
      "all ages of the Church. Nor have there been wanting instances of modern\n",
      "enthusiasts who have made a religion of communism; in every age of\n",
      "religious excitement notions like Wycliffe's 'inheritance of grace'\n",
      "have tended to prevail. A like spirit, but fiercer and more violent,\n",
      "has appeared in politics. 'The preparation of the Gospel of peace' soon\n",
      "becomes the red flag of Republicanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can hardly judge what effect Plato's views would have upon his\n",
      "own contemporaries; they would perhaps have seemed to them only an\n",
      "exaggeration of the Spartan commonwealth. Even modern writers would\n",
      "acknowledge that the right of private property is based on expediency,\n",
      "and may be interfered with in a variety of ways for the public good. Any\n",
      "other mode of vesting property which was found to be more advantageous,\n",
      "would in time acquire the same basis of right; 'the most useful,' in\n",
      "Plato's words, 'would be the most sacred.' The lawyers and ecclesiastics\n",
      "of former ages would have spoken of property as a sacred institution.\n",

      "wealth which is customary in civilized countries the most favourable\n",
      "that can be conceived for the education and development of the mass\n",
      "of mankind? Can 'the spectator of all time and all existence' be quite\n",
      "convinced that one or two thousand years hence, great changes will not\n",
      "have taken place in the rights of property, or even that the very notion\n",
      "of property, beyond what is necessary for personal maintenance, may not\n",
      "have disappeared? This was a distinction familiar to Aristotle, though\n",
      "likely to be laughed at among ourselves. Such a change would not be\n",
      "greater than some other changes through which the world has passed\n",
      "in the transition from ancient to modern society, for example, the\n",
      "emancipation of the serfs in Russia, or the abolition of slavery in\n",

      "Many opinions and beliefs which have been cherished among ourselves\n",
      "quite as strongly as the sacredness of property have passed away; and\n",

      "Some one will be heard to ask whether a state of society can be final in\n",

      "condition may, after all, be only transitional, and may conduct to a\n",
      "higher, in which property, besides ministering to the enjoyment of the\n",
      "few, may also furnish the means of the highest culture to all, and will\n",
      "be a greater benefit to the public generally, and also more under the\n",
      "control of public authority. There may come a time when the saying,\n",

      "in the goddesses Athene and Artemis, and in the heroines Antigone and\n",

      "Athenian woman was in no way the equal of her husband; she was not the\n",
      "entertainer of his guests or the mistress of his house, but only his\n",
      "housekeeper and the mother of his children. She took no part in military\n",
      "or political matters; nor is there any instance in the later ages of\n",
      "Greece of a woman becoming famous in literature. 'Hers is the greatest\n",
      "glory who has the least renown among men,' is the historian's conception\n",
      "of feminine excellence. A very different ideal of womanhood is held up\n",
      "by Plato to the world; she is to be the companion of the man, and to\n",
      "share with him in the toils of war and in the cares of government. She\n",
      "is to be similarly trained both in bodily and mental exercises. She\n",

      "The modern antagonist of the equality of the sexes would argue that the\n",

      "urged by Plato; that sensibility, gentleness, grace, are the qualities\n",
      "of women, while energy, strength, higher intelligence, are to be looked\n",
      "for in men. And the criticism is just: the differences affect the whole\n",
      "nature, and are not, as Plato supposes, confined to a single point. But\n",
      "neither can we say how far these differences are due to education and\n",
      "the opinions of mankind, or physically inherited from the habits and\n",
      "opinions of former generations. Women have been always taught, not\n",
      "exactly that they are slaves, but that they are in an inferior position,\n",
      "which is also supposed to have compensating advantages; and to this\n",
      "position they have conformed. It is also true that the physical form may\n",
      "easily change in the course of generations through the mode of life; and\n",
      "the weakness or delicacy, which was once a matter of opinion, may become\n",
      "a physical fact. The characteristics of sex vary greatly in different\n",
      "countries and ranks of society, and at different ages in the same\n",
      "individuals. Plato may have been right in denying that there was any\n",
      "ultimate difference in the sexes of man other than that which exists in\n",
      "animals, because all other differences may be conceived to disappear in\n",
      "other states of society, or under different circumstances of life and\n",

      "The first wave having been passed, we proceed to the second--community\n",
      "of wives and children. 'Is it possible? Is it desirable?' For as Glaucon\n",
      "intimates, and as we far more strongly insist, 'Great doubts may\n",
      "be entertained about both these points.' Any free discussion of the\n",
      "question is impossible, and mankind are perhaps right in not allowing\n",
      "the ultimate bases of social life to be examined. Few of us can safely\n",
      "enquire into the things which nature hides, any more than we can\n",
      "dissect our own bodies. Still, the manner in which Plato arrived at his\n",
      "conclusions should be considered. For here, as Mr. Grote has remarked,\n",
      "is a wonderful thing, that one of the wisest and best of men should have\n",
      "entertained ideas of morality which are wholly at variance with our\n",
      "own. And if we would do Plato justice, we must examine carefully the\n",
      "character of his proposals. First, we may observe that the relations of\n",
      "the sexes supposed by him are the reverse of licentious: he seems rather\n",
      "to aim at an impossible strictness. Secondly, he conceives the family\n",
      "to be the natural enemy of the state; and he entertains the serious\n",
      "hope that an universal brotherhood may take the place of private\n",
      "interests--an aspiration which, although not justified by experience,\n",
      "has possessed many noble minds. On the other hand, there is no sentiment\n",
      "or imagination in the connections which men and women are supposed by\n",
      "him to form; human beings return to the level of the animals, neither\n",
      "exalting to heaven, nor yet abusing the natural instincts. All that\n",
      "world of poetry and fancy which the passion of love has called forth\n",
      "in modern literature and romance would have been banished by Plato. The\n",
      "arrangements of marriage in the Republic are directed to one object--the\n",
      "improvement of the race. In successive generations a great development\n",
      "both of bodily and mental qualities might be possible. The analogy of\n",
      "animals tends to show that mankind can within certain limits receive a\n",
      "change of nature. And as in animals we should commonly choose the best\n",
      "for breeding, and destroy the others, so there must be a selection made\n",
      "of the human beings whose lives are worthy to be preserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "We start back horrified from this Platonic ideal, in the belief, first,\n",
      "that the higher feelings of humanity are far too strong to be crushed\n",
      "out; secondly, that if the plan could be carried into execution we\n",
      "should be poorly recompensed by improvements in the breed for the loss\n",
      "of the best things in life. The greatest regard for the weakest and\n",
      "meanest of human beings--the infant, the criminal, the insane, the\n",
      "idiot, truly seems to us one of the noblest results of Christianity. We\n",
      "have learned, though as yet imperfectly, that the individual man has an\n",
      "endless value in the sight of God, and that we honour Him when we honour\n",
      "the darkened and disfigured image of Him (Laws). This is the lesson\n",
      "which Christ taught in a parable when He said, 'Their angels do always\n",
      "behold the face of My Father which is in heaven.' Such lessons are only\n",
      "partially realized in any age; they were foreign to the age of Plato, as\n",
      "they have very different degrees of strength in different countries or\n",
      "ages of the Christian world. To the Greek the family was a religious and\n",
      "customary institution binding the members together by a tie inferior\n",
      "in strength to that of friendship, and having a less solemn and sacred\n",
      "sound than that of country. The relationship which existed on the lower\n",
      "level of custom, Plato imagined that he was raising to the higher level\n",
      "of nature and reason; while from the modern and Christian point of view\n",
      "we regard him as sanctioning murder and destroying the first principles\n",
      "of morality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The great error in these and similar speculations is that the difference\n",
      "between man and the animals is forgotten in them. The human being\n",
      "is regarded with the eye of a dog- or bird-fancier, or at best of a\n",
      "slave-owner; the higher or human qualities are left out. The breeder\n",
      "of animals aims chiefly at size or speed or strength; in a few cases at\n",

      "their superiority in fighting or in running or in drawing carts. Neither\n",
      "does the improvement of the human race consist merely in the increase\n",
      "of the bones and flesh, but in the growth and enlightenment of the mind.\n",
      "Hence there must be 'a marriage of true minds' as well as of bodies, of\n",
      "imagination and reason as well as of lusts and instincts. Men and women\n",
      "without feeling or imagination are justly called brutes; yet Plato\n",
      "takes away these qualities and puts nothing in their place, not even\n",
      "the desire of a noble offspring, since parents are not to know their own\n",
      "children. The most important transaction of social life, he who is the\n",

      "human and rational, afterwards the animal. Yet they are not absolutely\n",
      "divided; and in times of sickness or moments of self-indulgence they\n",

      "includes them both. Neither is the moral the limit of the physical,\n",
      "but the expansion and enlargement of it,--the highest form which the\n",
      "physical is capable of receiving. As Plato would say, the body does not\n",
      "take care of the body, and still less of the mind, but the mind takes\n",
      "care of both. In all human action not that which is common to man and\n",
      "the animals is the characteristic element, but that which distinguishes\n",

      "which is hardly credible, falling in an instant from the heaven of\n",

      "to prove the rule. The connexions formed between superior and\n",
      "inferior races hardly ever produce a noble offspring, because they are\n",

      "mother and are neglected by the father who is ashamed of them.\n",
      "Barbarous nations when they are introduced by Europeans to vice die\n",

      "carnivorous, have only one mate, and the love and care of offspring\n",
      "which seems to be natural is inconsistent with the primitive theory of\n",

      "may be directed to their prevention or cure. The traces of consumption\n",
      "may become fainter, or be wholly effaced: the inherent tendency to vice\n",
      "or crime may be eradicated. And so heredity, from being a curse, may\n",
      "become a blessing. We acknowledge that in the matter of our birth, as in\n",
      "our nature generally, there are previous circumstances which affect\n",
      "us. But upon this platform of circumstances or within this wall of\n",

      "experience, would have perished. For children can only be brought up in\n",
      "families. There is a subtle sympathy between the mother and the child\n",
      "which cannot be supplied by other mothers, or by 'strong nurses one or\n",

      "of a noble offspring was a passion among the Spartans, or that their\n",
      "physical superiority was to be attributed chiefly, not to their marriage\n",
      "customs, but to their temperance and training. He did not reflect that\n",
      "Sparta was great, not in consequence of the relaxation of morality, but\n",
      "in spite of it, by virtue of a political principle stronger far than\n",
      "existed in any other Grecian state. Least of all did he observe that\n",
      "Sparta did not really produce the finest specimens of the Greek\n",
      "race. The genius, the political inspiration of Athens, the love of\n",
      "liberty--all that has made Greece famous with posterity, were wanting\n",
      "among the Spartans. They had no Themistocles, or Pericles, or Aeschylus,\n",
      "or Sophocles, or Socrates, or Plato. The individual was not allowed to\n",
      "appear above the state; the laws were fixed, and he had no business to\n",

      "in the distance, he is still guided by his old maxims, and is the slave\n",
      "of his inveterate party prejudices; he cannot perceive the signs of the\n",

      "his own party, as the world without him becomes stronger. This seems to\n",
      "be the reason why the old order of things makes so poor a figure\n",
      "when confronted with the new, why churches can never reform, why most\n",
      "political changes are made blindly and convulsively. The great crises\n",
      "in the history of nations have often been met by an ecclesiastical\n",
      "positiveness, and a more obstinate reassertion of principles which\n",
      "have lost their hold upon a nation. The fixed ideas of a reactionary\n",
      "statesman may be compared to madness; they grow upon him, and he becomes\n",

      "(d) Plato, labouring under what, to modern readers, appears to have been\n",
      "a confusion of ideas, assimilates the state to the individual, and fails\n",
      "to distinguish Ethics from Politics. He thinks that to be most of a\n",
      "state which is most like one man, and in which the citizens have the\n",
      "greatest uniformity of character. He does not see that the analogy is\n",
      "partly fallacious, and that the will or character of a state or nation\n",
      "is really the balance or rather the surplus of individual wills, which\n",
      "are limited by the condition of having to act in common. The movement\n",
      "of a body of men can never have the pliancy or facility of a single man;\n",
      "the freedom of the individual, which is always limited, becomes still\n",
      "more straitened when transferred to a nation. The powers of action and\n",
      "feeling are necessarily weaker and more balanced when they are diffused\n",
      "through a community; whence arises the often discussed question, 'Can a\n",
      "nation, like an individual, have a conscience?' We hesitate to say\n",
      "that the characters of nations are nothing more than the sum of the\n",
      "characters of the individuals who compose them; because there may be\n",
      "tendencies in individuals which react upon one another. A whole nation\n",
      "may be wiser than any one man in it; or may be animated by some common\n",
      "opinion or feeling which could not equally have affected the mind of\n",
      "a single person, or may have been inspired by a leader of genius to\n",
      "perform acts more than human. Plato does not appear to have analysed\n",
      "the complications which arise out of the collective action of mankind.\n",
      "Neither is he capable of seeing that analogies, though specious as\n",
      "arguments, may often have no foundation in fact, or of distinguishing\n",
      "between what is intelligible or vividly present to the mind, and what\n",
      "is true. In this respect he is far below Aristotle, who is comparatively\n",
      "seldom imposed upon by false analogies. He cannot disentangle the arts\n",
      "from the virtues--at least he is always arguing from one to the other.\n",
      "His notion of music is transferred from harmony of sounds to harmony of\n",
      "life: in this he is assisted by the ambiguities of language as well as\n",
      "by the prevalence of Pythagorean notions. And having once assimilated\n",
      "the state to the individual, he imagines that he will find the\n",
      "succession of states paralleled in the lives of individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, through this fallacious medium, a real enlargement of ideas is\n",
      "attained. When the virtues as yet presented no distinct conception to\n",
      "the mind, a great advance was made by the comparison of them with the\n",
      "arts; for virtue is partly art, and has an outward form as well as an\n",
      "inward principle. The harmony of music affords a lively image of the\n",
      "harmonies of the world and of human life, and may be regarded as a\n",
      "splendid illustration which was naturally mistaken for a real analogy.\n",
      "In the same way the identification of ethics with politics has a\n",
      "tendency to give definiteness to ethics, and also to elevate and ennoble\n",
      "men's notions of the aims of government and of the duties of citizens;\n",
      "for ethics from one point of view may be conceived as an idealized law\n",
      "and politics; and politics, as ethics reduced to the conditions of human\n",
      "society. There have been evils which have arisen out of the attempt to\n",
      "identify them, and this has led to the separation or antagonism of\n",
      "them, which has been introduced by modern political writers. But we may\n",
      "likewise feel that something has been lost in their separation, and\n",
      "that the ancient philosophers who estimated the moral and intellectual\n",
      "wellbeing of mankind first, and the wealth of nations and individuals\n",
      "second, may have a salutary influence on the speculations of modern\n",
      "times. Many political maxims originate in a reaction against an opposite\n",

      "3. Plato's views of education are in several respects remarkable;\n",
      "like the rest of the Republic they are partly Greek and partly ideal,\n",
      "beginning with the ordinary curriculum of the Greek youth, and extending\n",
      "to after-life. Plato is the first writer who distinctly says that\n",
      "education is to comprehend the whole of life, and to be a preparation\n",
      "for another in which education begins again. This is the continuous\n",
      "thread which runs through the Republic, and which more than any other of\n",
      "his ideas admits of an application to modern life.\n",
      "\n",
      "He has long given up the notion that virtue cannot be taught; and he is\n",
      "disposed to modify the thesis of the Protagoras, that the virtues are\n",
      "one and not many. He is not unwilling to admit the sensible world\n",
      "into his scheme of truth. Nor does he assert in the Republic the\n",
      "involuntariness of vice, which is maintained by him in the Timaeus,\n",
      "Sophist, and Laws (Protag., Apol., Gorg.). Nor do the so-called Platonic\n",
      "ideas recovered from a former state of existence affect his theory\n",
      "of mental improvement. Still we observe in him the remains of the old\n",
      "Socratic doctrine, that true knowledge must be elicited from within, and\n",
      "is to be sought for in ideas, not in particulars of sense. Education, as\n",
      "he says, will implant a principle of intelligence which is better than\n",
      "ten thousand eyes. The paradox that the virtues are one, and the kindred\n",
      "notion that all virtue is knowledge, are not entirely renounced; the\n",
      "first is seen in the supremacy given to justice over the rest; the\n",
      "second in the tendency to absorb the moral virtues in the intellectual,\n",
      "and to centre all goodness in the contemplation of the idea of good. The\n",
      "world of sense is still depreciated and identified with opinion, though\n",
      "admitted to be a shadow of the true. In the Republic he is evidently\n",
      "impressed with the conviction that vice arises chiefly from ignorance\n",
      "and may be cured by education; the multitude are hardly to be deemed\n",
      "responsible for what they do. A faint allusion to the doctrine of\n",
      "reminiscence occurs in the Tenth Book; but Plato's views of education\n",
      "have no more real connection with a previous state of existence than\n",
      "our own; he only proposes to elicit from the mind that which is there\n",
      "already. Education is represented by him, not as the filling of a\n",
      "vessel, but as the turning the eye of the soul towards the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "He treats first of music or literature, which he divides into true and\n",
      "false, and then goes on to gymnastics; of infancy in the Republic he\n",
      "takes no notice, though in the Laws he gives sage counsels about the\n",
      "nursing of children and the management of the mothers, and would have\n",
      "an education which is even prior to birth. But in the Republic he begins\n",
      "with the age at which the child is capable of receiving ideas, and\n",
      "boldly asserts, in language which sounds paradoxical to modern ears,\n",
      "that he must be taught the false before he can learn the true. The\n",
      "modern and ancient philosophical world are not agreed about truth and\n",
      "falsehood; the one identifies truth almost exclusively with fact, the\n",
      "other with ideas. This is the difference between ourselves and Plato,\n",
      "which is, however, partly a difference of words. For we too should admit\n",
      "that a child must receive many lessons which he imperfectly understands;\n",
      "he must be taught some things in a figure only, some too which he can\n",
      "hardly be expected to believe when he grows older; but we should limit\n",
      "the use of fiction by the necessity of the case. Plato would draw the\n",
      "line differently; according to him the aim of early education is not\n",
      "truth as a matter of fact, but truth as a matter of principle; the child\n",
      "is to be taught first simple religious truths, and then simple moral\n",
      "truths, and insensibly to learn the lesson of good manners and good\n",
      "taste. He would make an entire reformation of the old mythology; like\n",
      "Xenophanes and Heracleitus he is sensible of the deep chasm which\n",
      "separates his own age from Homer and Hesiod, whom he quotes and invests\n",
      "with an imaginary authority, but only for his own purposes. The lusts\n",
      "and treacheries of the gods are to be banished; the terrors of the world\n",
      "below are to be dispelled; the misbehaviour of the Homeric heroes is\n",
      "not to be a model for youth. But there is another strain heard in Homer\n",
      "which may teach our youth endurance; and something may be learnt in\n",
      "medicine from the simple practice of the Homeric age. The principles\n",
      "on which religion is to be based are two only: first, that God is true;\n",
      "secondly, that he is good. Modern and Christian writers have often\n",
      "fallen short of these; they can hardly be said to have gone beyond them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The young are to be brought up in happy surroundings, out of the way of\n",
      "sights or sounds which may hurt the character or vitiate the taste.\n",
      "They are to live in an atmosphere of health; the breeze is always to\n",
      "be wafting to them the impressions of truth and goodness. Could such\n",
      "an education be realized, or if our modern religious education could\n",
      "be bound up with truth and virtue and good manners and good taste, that\n",
      "would be the best hope of human improvement. Plato, like ourselves,\n",
      "is looking forward to changes in the moral and religious world, and is\n",
      "preparing for them. He recognizes the danger of unsettling young men's\n",
      "minds by sudden changes of laws and principles, by destroying the\n",
      "sacredness of one set of ideas when there is nothing else to take their\n",
      "place. He is afraid too of the influence of the drama, on the ground\n",
      "that it encourages false sentiment, and therefore he would not have\n",
      "his children taken to the theatre; he thinks that the effect on the\n",
      "spectators is bad, and on the actors still worse. His idea of education\n",
      "is that of harmonious growth, in which are insensibly learnt the lessons\n",
      "of temperance and endurance, and the body and mind develope in equal\n",
      "proportions. The first principle which runs through all art and nature\n",
      "is simplicity; this also is to be the rule of human life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second stage of education is gymnastic, which answers to the period\n",
      "of muscular growth and development. The simplicity which is enforced in\n",
      "music is extended to gymnastic; Plato is aware that the training of the\n",
      "body may be inconsistent with the training of the mind, and that bodily\n",
      "exercise may be easily overdone. Excessive training of the body is\n",
      "apt to give men a headache or to render them sleepy at a lecture on\n",
      "philosophy, and this they attribute not to the true cause, but to the\n",
      "nature of the subject. Two points are noticeable in Plato's treatment of\n",
      "gymnastic:--First, that the time of training is entirely separated from\n",
      "the time of literary education. He seems to have thought that two things\n",
      "of an opposite and different nature could not be learnt at the same\n",
      "time. Here we can hardly agree with him; and, if we may judge by\n",
      "experience, the effect of spending three years between the ages of\n",
      "fourteen and seventeen in mere bodily exercise would be far from\n",
      "improving to the intellect. Secondly, he affirms that music and\n",
      "gymnastic are not, as common opinion is apt to imagine, intended, the\n",
      "one for the cultivation of the mind and the other of the body, but that\n",
      "they are both equally designed for the improvement of the mind. The\n",
      "body, in his view, is the servant of the mind; the subjection of the\n",
      "lower to the higher is for the advantage of both. And doubtless the\n",
      "mind may exercise a very great and paramount influence over the body,\n",
      "if exerted not at particular moments and by fits and starts, but\n",
      "continuously, in making preparation for the whole of life. Other Greek\n",
      "writers saw the mischievous tendency of Spartan discipline (Arist. Pol;\n",
      "Thuc.). But only Plato recognized the fundamental error on which the\n",
      "practice was based.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject of gymnastic leads Plato to the sister subject of medicine,\n",
      "which he further illustrates by the parallel of law. The modern\n",
      "disbelief in medicine has led in this, as in some other departments of\n",
      "knowledge, to a demand for greater simplicity; physicians are becoming\n",
      "aware that they often make diseases 'greater and more complicated' by\n",
      "their treatment of them (Rep.). In two thousand years their art has made\n",
      "but slender progress; what they have gained in the analysis of the parts\n",
      "is in a great degree lost by their feebler conception of the human frame\n",
      "as a whole. They have attended more to the cure of diseases than to the\n",
      "conditions of health; and the improvements in medicine have been more\n",
      "than counterbalanced by the disuse of regular training. Until lately\n",
      "they have hardly thought of air and water, the importance of which was\n",
      "well understood by the ancients; as Aristotle remarks, 'Air and water,\n",
      "being the elements which we most use, have the greatest effect upon\n",
      "health' (Polit.). For ages physicians have been under the dominion of\n",
      "prejudices which have only recently given way; and now there are as many\n",
      "opinions in medicine as in theology, and an equal degree of scepticism\n",
      "and some want of toleration about both. Plato has several good notions\n",
      "about medicine; according to him, 'the eye cannot be cured without the\n",
      "rest of the body, nor the body without the mind' (Charm.). No man\n",
      "of sense, he says in the Timaeus, would take physic; and we heartily\n",
      "sympathize with him in the Laws when he declares that 'the limbs of the\n",
      "rustic worn with toil will derive more benefit from warm baths than from\n",
      "the prescriptions of a not over wise doctor.' But we can hardly praise\n",
      "him when, in obedience to the authority of Homer, he depreciates diet,\n",
      "or approve of the inhuman spirit in which he would get rid of invalid\n",
      "and useless lives by leaving them to die. He does not seem to have\n",
      "considered that the 'bridle of Theages' might be accompanied by\n",
      "qualities which were of far more value to the State than the health\n",
      "or strength of the citizens; or that the duty of taking care of the\n",
      "helpless might be an important element of education in a State. The\n",
      "physician himself (this is a delicate and subtle observation) should\n",
      "not be a man in robust health; he should have, in modern phraseology,\n",
      "a nervous temperament; he should have experience of disease in his own\n",
      "person, in order that his powers of observation may be quickened in the\n",
      "case of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The perplexity of medicine is paralleled by the perplexity of law; in\n",
      "which, again, Plato would have men follow the golden rule of simplicity.\n",
      "Greater matters are to be determined by the legislator or by the oracle\n",
      "of Delphi, lesser matters are to be left to the temporary regulation\n",
      "of the citizens themselves. Plato is aware that laissez faire is an\n",
      "important element of government. The diseases of a State are like the\n",
      "heads of a hydra; they multiply when they are cut off. The true remedy\n",
      "for them is not extirpation but prevention. And the way to prevent them\n",
      "is to take care of education, and education will take care of all the\n",
      "rest. So in modern times men have often felt that the only political\n",
      "measure worth having--the only one which would produce any certain or\n",
      "lasting effect, was a measure of national education. And in our own more\n",
      "than in any previous age the necessity has been recognized of restoring\n",
      "the ever-increasing confusion of law to simplicity and common sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the training in music and gymnastic is completed, there follows the\n",
      "first stage of active and public life. But soon education is to begin\n",
      "again from a new point of view. In the interval between the Fourth and\n",
      "Seventh Books we have discussed the nature of knowledge, and have thence\n",
      "been led to form a higher conception of what was required of us. For\n",
      "true knowledge, according to Plato, is of abstractions, and has to do,\n",
      "not with particulars or individuals, but with universals only; not with\n",
      "the beauties of poetry, but with the ideas of philosophy. And the great\n",
      "aim of education is the cultivation of the habit of abstraction. This\n",
      "is to be acquired through the study of the mathematical sciences. They\n",
      "alone are capable of giving ideas of relation, and of arousing the\n",
      "dormant energies of thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mathematics in the age of Plato comprehended a very small part of that\n",
      "which is now included in them; but they bore a much larger proportion to\n",
      "the sum of human knowledge. They were the only organon of thought which\n",
      "the human mind at that time possessed, and the only measure by which\n",
      "the chaos of particulars could be reduced to rule and order. The\n",
      "faculty which they trained was naturally at war with the poetical\n",
      "or imaginative; and hence to Plato, who is everywhere seeking for\n",
      "abstractions and trying to get rid of the illusions of sense, nearly\n",
      "the whole of education is contained in them. They seemed to have an\n",
      "inexhaustible application, partly because their true limits were not yet\n",
      "understood. These Plato himself is beginning to investigate; though\n",
      "not aware that number and figure are mere abstractions of sense,\n",
      "he recognizes that the forms used by geometry are borrowed from the\n",
      "sensible world. He seeks to find the ultimate ground of mathematical\n",
      "ideas in the idea of good, though he does not satisfactorily explain the\n",
      "connexion between them; and in his conception of the relation of ideas\n",
      "to numbers, he falls very far short of the definiteness attributed to\n",
      "him by Aristotle (Met.). But if he fails to recognize the true limits of\n",
      "mathematics, he also reaches a point beyond them; in his view, ideas\n",
      "of number become secondary to a higher conception of knowledge. The\n",
      "dialectician is as much above the mathematician as the mathematician is\n",
      "above the ordinary man. The one, the self-proving, the good which is\n",
      "the higher sphere of dialectic, is the perfect truth to which all things\n",
      "ascend, and in which they finally repose.\n",
      "\n",
      "This self-proving unity or idea of good is a mere vision of which no\n",
      "distinct explanation can be given, relative only to a particular stage\n",
      "in Greek philosophy. It is an abstraction under which no individuals\n",
      "are comprehended, a whole which has no parts (Arist., Nic. Eth.). The\n",
      "vacancy of such a form was perceived by Aristotle, but not by Plato.\n",
      "Nor did he recognize that in the dialectical process are included two or\n",
      "more methods of investigation which are at variance with each other.\n",
      "He did not see that whether he took the longer or the shorter road, no\n",
      "advance could be made in this way. And yet such visions often have an\n",
      "immense effect; for although the method of science cannot anticipate\n",
      "science, the idea of science, not as it is, but as it will be in the\n",
      "future, is a great and inspiring principle. In the pursuit of knowledge\n",
      "we are always pressing forward to something beyond us; and as a false\n",
      "conception of knowledge, for example the scholastic philosophy, may lead\n",
      "men astray during many ages, so the true ideal, though vacant, may draw\n",
      "all their thoughts in a right direction. It makes a great difference\n",
      "whether the general expectation of knowledge, as this indefinite feeling\n",
      "may be termed, is based upon a sound judgment. For mankind may often\n",
      "entertain a true conception of what knowledge ought to be when they have\n",
      "but a slender experience of facts. The correlation of the sciences, the\n",
      "consciousness of the unity of nature, the idea of classification, the\n",
      "sense of proportion, the unwillingness to stop short of certainty or to\n",
      "confound probability with truth, are important principles of the higher\n",
      "education. Although Plato could tell us nothing, and perhaps knew that\n",
      "he could tell us nothing, of the absolute truth, he has exercised\n",
      "an influence on the human mind which even at the present day is not\n",
      "exhausted; and political and social questions may yet arise in which the\n",
      "thoughts of Plato may be read anew and receive a fresh meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Idea of good is so called only in the Republic, but there are traces\n",
      "of it in other dialogues of Plato. It is a cause as well as an idea, and\n",
      "from this point of view may be compared with the creator of the Timaeus,\n",
      "who out of his goodness created all things. It corresponds to a certain\n",

      "under the aspect of beauty, and is supposed to be attained there by\n",
      "stages of initiation, as here by regular gradations of knowledge. Viewed\n",
      "subjectively, it is the process or science of dialectic. This is the\n",
      "science which, according to the Phaedrus, is the true basis of rhetoric,\n",
      "which alone is able to distinguish the natures and classes of men and\n",
      "things; which divides a whole into the natural parts, and reunites the\n",
      "scattered parts into a natural or organized whole; which defines the\n",
      "abstract essences or universal ideas of all things, and connects them;\n",
      "which pierces the veil of hypotheses and reaches the final cause or\n",
      "first principle of all; which regards the sciences in relation to the\n",
      "idea of good. This ideal science is the highest process of thought,\n",
      "and may be described as the soul conversing with herself or holding\n",
      "communion with eternal truth and beauty, and in another form is\n",
      "the everlasting question and answer--the ceaseless interrogative of\n",
      "Socrates. The dialogues of Plato are themselves examples of the nature\n",
      "and method of dialectic. Viewed objectively, the idea of good is a power\n",
      "or cause which makes the world without us correspond with the world\n",
      "within. Yet this world without us is still a world of ideas. With Plato\n",
      "the investigation of nature is another department of knowledge, and in\n",
      "this he seeks to attain only probable conclusions (Timaeus).\n",
      "\n",
      "If we ask whether this science of dialectic which Plato only half\n",
      "explains to us is more akin to logic or to metaphysics, the answer is\n",
      "that in his mind the two sciences are not as yet distinguished, any more\n",
      "than the subjective and objective aspects of the world and of man, which\n",
      "German philosophy has revealed to us. Nor has he determined whether\n",
      "his science of dialectic is at rest or in motion, concerned with the\n",
      "contemplation of absolute being, or with a process of development\n",
      "and evolution. Modern metaphysics may be described as the science of\n",
      "abstractions, or as the science of the evolution of thought; modern\n",
      "logic, when passing beyond the bounds of mere Aristotelian forms, may be\n",
      "defined as the science of method. The germ of both of them is contained\n",
      "in the Platonic dialectic; all metaphysicians have something in common\n",
      "with the ideas of Plato; all logicians have derived something from\n",
      "the method of Plato. The nearest approach in modern philosophy to the\n",
      "universal science of Plato, is to be found in the Hegelian 'succession\n",
      "of moments in the unity of the idea.' Plato and Hegel alike seem to\n",
      "have conceived the world as the correlation of abstractions; and not\n",
      "impossibly they would have understood one another better than any of\n",
      "their commentators understand them (Swift's Voyage to Laputa. 'Having\n",
      "a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit and\n",
      "learning, I set apart one day on purpose. I proposed that Homer and\n",
      "Aristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these\n",
      "were so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court\n",
      "and outward rooms of the palace. I knew, and could distinguish these two\n",
      "heroes, at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.\n",
      "Homer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect\n",
      "for one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever\n",
      "beheld. Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff. His visage was\n",
      "meagre, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow. I soon discovered\n",
      "that both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company,\n",
      "and had never seen or heard of them before. And I had a whisper from a\n",
      "ghost, who shall be nameless, \"That these commentators always kept in\n",
      "the most distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world,\n",
      "through a consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly\n",
      "misrepresented the meaning of these authors to posterity.\" I introduced\n",
      "Didymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them\n",
      "better than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a\n",
      "genius to enter into the spirit of a poet. But Aristotle was out of all\n",
      "patience with the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented\n",
      "them to him; and he asked them \"whether the rest of the tribe were as\n",
      "great dunces as themselves?\"'). There is, however, a difference between\n",
      "them: for whereas Hegel is thinking of all the minds of men as one mind,\n",
      "which developes the stages of the idea in different countries or at\n",
      "different times in the same country, with Plato these gradations are\n",
      "regarded only as an order of thought or ideas; the history of the human\n",
      "mind had not yet dawned upon him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many criticisms may be made on Plato's theory of education. While in\n",
      "some respects he unavoidably falls short of modern thinkers, in others\n",
      "he is in advance of them. He is opposed to the modes of education which\n",
      "prevailed in his own time; but he can hardly be said to have discovered\n",
      "new ones. He does not see that education is relative to the characters\n",
      "of individuals; he only desires to impress the same form of the state on\n",
      "the minds of all. He has no sufficient idea of the effect of literature\n",
      "on the formation of the mind, and greatly exaggerates that of\n",
      "mathematics. His aim is above all things to train the reasoning\n",
      "faculties; to implant in the mind the spirit and power of abstraction;\n",
      "to explain and define general notions, and, if possible, to connect\n",
      "them. No wonder that in the vacancy of actual knowledge his followers,\n",
      "and at times even he himself, should have fallen away from the doctrine\n",
      "of ideas, and have returned to that branch of knowledge in which alone\n",
      "the relation of the one and many can be truly seen--the science of\n",
      "number. In his views both of teaching and training he might be styled,\n",
      "in modern language, a doctrinaire; after the Spartan fashion he would\n",
      "have his citizens cast in one mould; he does not seem to consider that\n",
      "some degree of freedom, 'a little wholesome neglect,' is necessary to\n",
      "strengthen and develope the character and to give play to the individual\n",
      "nature. His citizens would not have acquired that knowledge which in\n",
      "the vision of Er is supposed to be gained by the pilgrims from their\n",
      "experience of evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, Plato is far in advance of modern philosophers and\n",
      "theologians when he teaches that education is to be continued through\n",
      "life and will begin again in another. He would never allow education of\n",
      "some kind to cease; although he was aware that the proverbial saying of\n",
      "Solon, 'I grow old learning many things,' cannot be applied literally.\n",
      "Himself ravished with the contemplation of the idea of good, and\n",
      "delighting in solid geometry (Rep.), he has no difficulty in imagining\n",
      "that a lifetime might be passed happily in such pursuits. We who know\n",
      "how many more men of business there are in the world than real students\n",
      "or thinkers, are not equally sanguine. The education which he proposes\n",
      "for his citizens is really the ideal life of the philosopher or man of\n",
      "genius, interrupted, but only for a time, by practical duties,--a life\n",
      "not for the many, but for the few.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the thought of Plato may not be wholly incapable of application to\n",
      "our own times. Even if regarded as an ideal which can never be realized,\n",
      "it may have a great effect in elevating the characters of mankind,\n",
      "and raising them above the routine of their ordinary occupation or\n",
      "profession. It is the best form under which we can conceive the whole\n",
      "of life. Nevertheless the idea of Plato is not easily put into practice.\n",
      "For the education of after life is necessarily the education which each\n",
      "one gives himself. Men and women cannot be brought together in schools\n",
      "or colleges at forty or fifty years of age; and if they could the result\n",
      "would be disappointing. The destination of most men is what Plato would\n",
      "call 'the Den' for the whole of life, and with that they are content.\n",
      "Neither have they teachers or advisers with whom they can take counsel\n",
      "in riper years. There is no 'schoolmaster abroad' who will tell them of\n",
      "their faults, or inspire them with the higher sense of duty, or with the\n",
      "ambition of a true success in life; no Socrates who will convict them\n",
      "of ignorance; no Christ, or follower of Christ, who will reprove them\n",
      "of sin. Hence they have a difficulty in receiving the first element of\n",
      "improvement, which is self-knowledge. The hopes of youth no longer stir\n",
      "them; they rather wish to rest than to pursue high objects. A few\n",
      "only who have come across great men and women, or eminent teachers of\n",
      "religion and morality, have received a second life from them, and have\n",
      "lighted a candle from the fire of their genius.\n",
      "\n",
      "The want of energy is one of the main reasons why so few persons\n",
      "continue to improve in later years. They have not the will, and do not\n",
      "know the way. They 'never try an experiment,' or look up a point\n",
      "of interest for themselves; they make no sacrifices for the sake of\n",
      "knowledge; their minds, like their bodies, at a certain age become\n",
      "fixed. Genius has been defined as 'the power of taking pains'; but\n",
      "hardly any one keeps up his interest in knowledge throughout a whole\n",
      "life. The troubles of a family, the business of making money, the\n",
      "demands of a profession destroy the elasticity of the mind. The waxen\n",
      "tablet of the memory which was once capable of receiving 'true thoughts\n",
      "and clear impressions' becomes hard and crowded; there is not room\n",
      "for the accumulations of a long life (Theaet.). The student, as years\n",
      "advance, rather makes an exchange of knowledge than adds to his stores.\n",
      "There is no pressing necessity to learn; the stock of Classics or\n",
      "History or Natural Science which was enough for a man at twenty-five is\n",
      "enough for him at fifty. Neither is it easy to give a definite answer to\n",
      "any one who asks how he is to improve. For self-education consists in a\n",

      "by nature something of what we are not; in learning to see ourselves as\n",
      "others see us; in judging, not by opinion, but by the evidence of facts;\n",
      "in seeking out the society of superior minds; in a study of lives and\n",
      "writings of great men; in observation of the world and character; in\n",

      "had never been seen, and therefore could not be conceived by them. Their\n",
      "experience (Aristot. Metaph.; Plato, Laws) led them to conclude that\n",
      "there had been cycles of civilization in which the arts had been\n",
      "discovered and lost many times over, and cities had been overthrown and\n",
      "rebuilt again and again, and deluges and volcanoes and other natural\n",
      "convulsions had altered the face of the earth. Tradition told them of\n",
      "many destructions of mankind and of the preservation of a remnant.\n",
      "The world began again after a deluge and was reconstructed out of the\n",
      "fragments of itself. Also they were acquainted with empires of unknown\n",
      "antiquity, like the Egyptian or Assyrian; but they had never seen them\n",
      "grow, and could not imagine, any more than we can, the state of man\n",
      "which preceded them. They were puzzled and awestricken by the Egyptian\n",
      "monuments, of which the forms, as Plato says, not in a figure, but\n",

      "enactments at Athens were disputed over as if they had been the words of\n",
      "Solon himself. Plato hopes to preserve in a later generation the mind of\n",

      "impression left on the human mind by the growth of the Roman Empire\n",

      "\n",
      "(1) The Republic, though probably written at intervals, yet speaking\n",
      "generally and judging by the indications of thought and style, may be\n",
      "reasonably ascribed to the middle period of Plato's life: the Laws are\n",
      "certainly the work of his declining years, and some portions of them at\n",
      "any rate seem to have been written in extreme old age.\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) The Republic is full of hope and aspiration: the Laws bear the stamp\n",
      "of failure and disappointment. The one is a finished work which received\n",
      "the last touches of the author: the other is imperfectly executed, and\n",
      "apparently unfinished. The one has the grace and beauty of youth: the\n",
      "other has lost the poetical form, but has more of the severity and\n",
      "knowledge of life which is characteristic of old age.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) The most conspicuous defect of the Laws is the failure of dramatic\n",
      "power, whereas the Republic is full of striking contrasts of ideas and\n",
      "oppositions of character.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) The Laws may be said to have more the nature of a sermon,\n",
      "the Republic of a poem; the one is more religious, the other more\n",
      "intellectual.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) Many theories of Plato, such as the doctrine of ideas, the\n",
      "government of the world by philosophers, are not found in the Laws;\n",
      "the immortality of the soul is first mentioned in xii; the person of\n",
      "Socrates has altogether disappeared. The community of women and children\n",
      "is renounced; the institution of common or public meals for women (Laws)\n",
      "is for the first time introduced (Ar. Pol.).\n",
      "\n",
      "(6) There remains in the Laws the old enmity to the poets, who are\n",
      "ironically saluted in high-flown terms, and, at the same time, are\n",
      "peremptorily ordered out of the city, if they are not willing to submit\n",
      "their poems to the censorship of the magistrates (Rep.).\n",
      "\n",
      "(7) Though the work is in most respects inferior, there are a few\n",
      "passages in the Laws, such as the honour due to the soul, the evils\n",
      "of licentious or unnatural love, the whole of Book x. (religion), the\n",
      "dishonesty of retail trade, and bequests, which come more home to us,\n",

      "'The same, or nearly the same, objections apply to Plato's later work,\n",
      "the Laws, and therefore we had better examine briefly the constitution\n",
      "which is therein described. In the Republic, Socrates has definitely\n",
      "settled in all a few questions only; such as the community of women and\n",
      "children, the community of property, and the constitution of the state.\n",
      "The population is divided into two classes--one of husbandmen, and\n",
      "the other of warriors; from this latter is taken a third class of\n",
      "counsellors and rulers of the state. But Socrates has not determined\n",
      "whether the husbandmen and artists are to have a share in the\n",
      "government, and whether they too are to carry arms and share in military\n",
      "service or not. He certainly thinks that the women ought to share in the\n",
      "education of the guardians, and to fight by their side. The remainder of\n",
      "the work is filled up with digressions foreign to the main subject, and\n",
      "with discussions about the education of the guardians. In the Laws there\n",

      "to be the same in both states; there is to be the same education; the\n",

      "are to be common meals in both. The only difference is that in the Laws\n",

      "have gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to\n",
      "enquire, whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult.\n",
      "And this is a question which I should like to ask of you who have\n",
      "arrived at that time which the poets call the 'threshold of old age'--Is\n",
      "life harder towards the end, or what report do you give of it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men of my\n",
      "age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says;\n",
      "and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is--I cannot\n",
      "eat, I cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away:\n",
      "there was a good time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer\n",
      "life. Some complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations,\n",
      "and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the\n",
      "cause. But to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that which\n",
      "is not really in fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being old,\n",
      "and every other old man, would have felt as they do. But this is not\n",
      "my own experience, nor that of others whom I have known. How well I\n",
      "remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How\n",
      "does love suit with age, Sophocles,--are you still the man you were?\n",
      "Peace, he replied; most gladly have I escaped the thing of which you\n",
      "speak; I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master. His\n",
      "words have often occurred to my mind since, and they seem as good to\n",
      "me now as at the time when he uttered them. For certainly old age has\n",
      "a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions relax their hold,\n",
      "then, as Sophocles says, we are freed from the grasp not of one mad\n",
      "master only, but of many. The truth is, Socrates, that these regrets,\n",
      "and also the complaints about relations, are to be attributed to the\n",
      "same cause, which is not old age, but men's characters and tempers; for\n",
      "he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of\n",
      "age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are\n",
      "equally a burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "I listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he might go\n",
      "on--Yes, Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in general\n",
      "are not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old\n",
      "age sits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but\n",
      "because you are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great comforter.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is\n",
      "something in what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I\n",
      "might answer them as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing\n",
      "him and saying that he was famous, not for his own merits but because he\n",
      "was an Athenian: 'If you had been a native of my country or I of yours,\n",
      "neither of us would have been famous.' And to those who are not rich and\n",
      "are impatient of old age, the same reply may be made; for to the good\n",
      "poor man old age cannot be a light burden, nor can a bad rich man ever\n",
      "have peace with himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "May I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part\n",
      "inherited or acquired by you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Acquired! Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? In the art\n",
      "of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather:\n",
      "for my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value of\n",
      "his patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I possess now;\n",
      "but my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present:\n",
      "and I shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a\n",
      "little more than I received.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see that you\n",
      "are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather of those\n",
      "who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired them;\n",
      "the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation of\n",
      "their own, resembling the affection of authors for their own poems, or\n",
      "of parents for their children, besides that natural love of it for the\n",
      "sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men. And hence\n",
      "they are very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but the\n",
      "praises of wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question?--What do you\n",
      "consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your\n",
      "wealth?\n",
      "\n",
      "One, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others.\n",
      "For let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near\n",
      "death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before;\n",
      "the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there\n",
      "of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he\n",
      "is tormented with the thought that they may be true: either from the\n",
      "weakness of age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that other\n",
      "place, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms\n",
      "crowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider what\n",
      "wrongs he has done to others. And when he finds that the sum of his\n",
      "transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his\n",
      "sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings. But to him who\n",
      "is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as Pindar charmingly says, is the\n",
      "kind nurse of his age:\n",
      "\n",
      "'Hope,' he says, 'cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice\n",
      "and holiness, and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his\n",
      "journey;--hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man.'\n",
      "\n",
      "How admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches, I do not\n",
      "say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion to\n",
      "deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally;\n",
      "and when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension\n",
      "about offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. Now to\n",
      "this peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes; and\n",
      "therefore I say, that, setting one thing against another, of the many\n",
      "advantages which wealth has to give, to a man of sense this is in my\n",
      "opinion the greatest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what is\n",
      "it?--to speak the truth and to pay your debts--no more than this? And\n",
      "even to this are there not exceptions? Suppose that a friend when in his\n",
      "right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is\n",
      "not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him? No one would\n",
      "say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so, any more than\n",
      "they would say that I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in\n",
      "his condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are quite right, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a\n",
      "correct definition of justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, said\n",
      "Polemarchus interposing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look after the\n",
      "sacrifices, and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is not Polemarchus your heir? I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the sacrifices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say, and\n",
      "according to you truly say, about justice?\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he\n",
      "appears to me to be right.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man, but\n",
      "his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear to\n",
      "me. For he certainly does not mean, as we were just now saying, that I\n",
      "ought to return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks\n",
      "for it when he is not in his right senses; and yet a deposit cannot be\n",
      "denied to be a debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no\n",
      "means to make the return?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did not\n",
      "mean to include that case?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a\n",
      "friend and never evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of\n",
      "the receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment of a\n",
      "debt,--that is what you would imagine him to say?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an enemy,\n",
      "as I take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him--that\n",
      "is to say, evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have spoken\n",
      "darkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that justice\n",
      "is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he termed a\n",
      "debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "That must have been his meaning, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "By heaven! I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is\n",
      "given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would\n",
      "make to us?\n",
      "\n",
      "He would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to\n",
      "human bodies.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "If, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding\n",
      "instances, then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil\n",
      "to enemies.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is his meaning then?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "And who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies\n",
      "in time of sickness?\n",
      "\n",
      "The physician.\n",
      "\n",

      "The pilot.\n",

      "And he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?\n",

      "No.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",

      "Like husbandry for the acquisition of corn?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",

      "Quite the reverse.\n",

      "Then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than\n",
      "the harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a\n",
      "better partner than the just man?\n",
      "\n",
      "In a money partnership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not\n",
      "want a just man to be your counsellor in the purchase or sale of a\n",
      "horse; a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that, would\n",
      "he not?\n",

      "Certainly.\n",

      "\n",
      "You mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie?\n",

      "Precisely.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them, you\n",

      "kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",

      "upon the enemy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?\n",
      "\n",
      "That, I suppose, is to be inferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is implied in the argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. And this is\n",
      "a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer; for he,\n",
      "speaking of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, who is a\n",
      "favourite of his, affirms that\n",
      "\n",
      "'He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art of\n",
      "theft; to be practised however 'for the good of friends and for the harm\n",
      "of enemies,'--that was what you were saying?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say; but I\n",
      "still stand by the latter words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, there is another question: By friends and enemies do we mean those\n",
      "who are so really, or only in seeming?\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks\n",
      "good, and to hate those whom he thinks evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who are not\n",
      "good seem to be so, and conversely?\n",
      "\n",
      "That is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their\n",
      "friends? True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil\n",
      "to the good?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the good are just and would not do an injustice?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",

      "wrong?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the\n",
      "unjust?\n",
      "\n",
      "I like that better.\n",
      "\n",
      "But see the consequence:--Many a man who is ignorant of human nature\n",
      "has friends who are bad friends, and in that case he ought to do harm to\n",
      "them; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so, we\n",
      "shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the\n",
      "meaning of Simonides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said: and I think that we had better correct an error\n",
      "into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend' and\n",
      "'enemy.'\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the error, Polemarchus? I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "We assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems, good;\n",

      "You would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to do\n",
      "good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: It\n",

      "\n",

      "stronger than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his\n",

      "Well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ;\n",
      "there are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are\n",
      "aristocracies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I know.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the government is the ruling power in each state?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the different forms of government make laws democratical,\n",
      "aristocratical, tyrannical, with a view to their several interests;\n",
      "and these laws, which are made by them for their own interests, are the\n",
      "justice which they deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses\n",
      "them they punish as a breaker of the law, and unjust. And that is what\n",
      "I mean when I say that in all states there is the same principle of\n",
      "justice, which is the interest of the government; and as the government\n",
      "must be supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion is, that\n",
      "everywhere there is one principle of justice, which is the interest of\n",
      "the stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not I will\n",
      "try to discover. But let me remark, that in defining justice you have\n",
      "yourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use. It is\n",
      "true, however, that in your definition the words 'of the stronger' are\n",
      "added.\n",
      "\n",
      "A small addition, you must allow, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire whether\n",
      "what you are saying is the truth. Now we are both agreed that justice\n",
      "is interest of some sort, but you go on to say 'of the stronger'; about\n",
      "this addition I am not so sure, and must therefore consider further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just for subjects to\n",
      "obey their rulers?\n",
      "\n",
      "I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they\n",
      "sometimes liable to err?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and\n",
      "sometimes not?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their interest;\n",
      "when they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects,--and that\n",
      "is what you call justice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Doubtless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to the\n",
      "interest of the stronger but the reverse?\n",
      "\n",
      "What is that you are saying? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am only repeating what you are saying, I believe. But let us consider:\n",
      "Have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own\n",
      "interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is justice?\n",
      "Has not that been admitted?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest\n",
      "of the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to be\n",
      "done which are to their own injury. For if, as you say, justice is the\n",
      "obedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O\n",
      "wisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker\n",
      "are commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the\n",
      "injury of the stronger?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for Thrasymachus\n",
      "himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for\n",
      "their own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Polemarchus,--Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was\n",
      "commanded by their rulers is just.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest of the\n",
      "stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further\n",
      "acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his\n",
      "subjects to do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that\n",
      "justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger what the\n",
      "stronger thought to be his interest,--this was what the weaker had to\n",
      "do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept his\n",
      "statement. Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what\n",
      "the stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken\n",
      "the stronger at the time when he is mistaken?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted that\n",
      "the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.\n",
      "\n",
      "You argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example, that he\n",
      "who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?\n",
      "or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or\n",
      "grammarian at the time when he is making the mistake, in respect of the\n",
      "mistake? True, we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian\n",
      "has made a mistake, but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact is\n",
      "that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a\n",
      "mistake in so far as he is what his name implies; they none of them\n",
      "err unless their skill fails them, and then they cease to be skilled\n",
      "artists. No artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what\n",
      "his name implies; though he is commonly said to err, and I adopted the\n",
      "common mode of speaking. But to be perfectly accurate, since you are\n",
      "such a lover of accuracy, we should say that the ruler, in so far as he\n",
      "is a ruler, is unerring, and, being unerring, always commands that which\n",
      "is for his own interest; and the subject is required to execute his\n",
      "commands; and therefore, as I said at first and now repeat, justice is\n",
      "the interest of the stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like an\n",
      "informer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of\n",
      "injuring you in the argument?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word--I know it; but you will be\n",
      "found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any\n",
      "misunderstanding occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what\n",
      "sense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were\n",
      "saying, he being the superior, it is just that the inferior should\n",
      "execute--is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the\n",
      "term?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the strictest of all senses, he said. And now cheat and play the\n",
      "informer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands. But you never will\n",
      "be able, never.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and cheat,\n",
      "Thrasymachus? I might as well shave a lion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you failed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enough, I said, of these civilities. It will be better that I should ask\n",
      "you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which\n",
      "you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? And remember\n",
      "that I am now speaking of the true physician.\n",
      "\n",
      "A healer of the sick, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the pilot--that is to say, the true pilot--is he a captain of\n",
      "sailors or a mere sailor?\n",
      "\n",
      "A captain of sailors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into\n",
      "account; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which he\n",
      "is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant of\n",
      "his skill and of his authority over the sailors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I said, every art has an interest?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "For which the art has to consider and provide?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that is the aim of art.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the interest of any art is the perfection of it--this and nothing\n",
      "else?\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.\n",
      "Suppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has\n",
      "wants, I should reply: Certainly the body has wants; for the body may\n",
      "be ill and require to be cured, and has therefore interests to which\n",
      "the art of medicine ministers; and this is the origin and intention of\n",
      "medicine, as you will acknowledge. Am I not right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite right, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any\n",
      "quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the\n",
      "ear fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide\n",
      "for the interests of seeing and hearing--has art in itself, I say, any\n",
      "similar liability to fault or defect, and does every art require another\n",
      "supplementary art to provide for its interests, and that another and\n",
      "another without end? Or have the arts to look only after their\n",
      "own interests? Or have they no need either of themselves or of\n",
      "another?--having no faults or defects, they have no need to correct\n",
      "them, either by the exercise of their own art or of any other; they have\n",
      "only to consider the interest of their subject-matter. For every art\n",
      "remains pure and faultless while remaining true--that is to say, while\n",
      "perfect and unimpaired. Take the words in your precise sense, and tell\n",
      "me whether I am not right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the\n",
      "interest of the body?\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of\n",
      "horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts\n",
      "care for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that\n",
      "which is the subject of their art?\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "Yes.\n",

      "sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of\n",
      "himself or his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of\n",
      "states, if they are true rulers, never think of their subjects as sheep,\n",
      "and that they are not studying their own advantage day and night. Oh,\n",
      "no; and so entirely astray are you in your ideas about the just and\n",
      "unjust as not even to know that justice and the just are in reality\n",
      "another's good; that is to say, the interest of the ruler and stronger,\n",
      "and the loss of the subject and servant; and injustice the opposite; for\n",
      "the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just: he is the stronger,\n",
      "and his subjects do what is for his interest, and minister to his\n",
      "happiness, which is very far from being their own. Consider further,\n",
      "most foolish Socrates, that the just is always a loser in comparison\n",
      "with the unjust. First of all, in private contracts: wherever the unjust\n",
      "is the partner of the just you will find that, when the partnership is\n",
      "dissolved, the unjust man has always more and the just less. Secondly,\n",
      "in their dealings with the State: when there is an income-tax, the just\n",
      "man will pay more and the unjust less on the same amount of income;\n",
      "and when there is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the\n",
      "other much. Observe also what happens when they take an office; there is\n",
      "the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other losses,\n",
      "and getting nothing out of the public, because he is just; moreover he\n",
      "is hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them in\n",
      "unlawful ways. But all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man.\n",
      "I am speaking, as before, of injustice on a large scale in which the\n",
      "advantage of the unjust is most apparent; and my meaning will be most\n",
      "clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the\n",
      "criminal is the happiest of men, and the sufferers or those who refuse\n",
      "to do injustice are the most miserable--that is to say tyranny, which by\n",
      "fraud and force takes away the property of others, not little by little\n",
      "but wholesale; comprehending in one, things sacred as well as profane,\n",
      "private and public; for which acts of wrong, if he were detected\n",
      "perpetrating any one of them singly, he would be punished and incur\n",
      "great disgrace--they who do such wrong in particular cases are called\n",
      "robbers of temples, and man-stealers and burglars and swindlers and\n",
      "thieves. But when a man besides taking away the money of the citizens\n",
      "has made slaves of them, then, instead of these names of reproach, he is\n",
      "termed happy and blessed, not only by the citizens but by all who\n",
      "hear of his having achieved the consummation of injustice. For mankind\n",
      "censure injustice, fearing that they may be the victims of it and not\n",
      "because they shrink from committing it. And thus, as I have shown,\n",
      "Socrates, injustice, when on a sufficient scale, has more strength and\n",
      "freedom and mastery than justice; and, as I said at first, justice is\n",
      "the interest of the stronger, whereas injustice is a man's own profit\n",
      "and interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bath-man, deluged\n",
      "our ears with his words, had a mind to go away. But the company\n",
      "would not let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his\n",
      "position; and I myself added my own humble request that he would not\n",
      "leave us. Thrasymachus, I said to him, excellent man, how suggestive\n",
      "are your remarks! And are you going to run away before you have fairly\n",
      "taught or learned whether they are true or not? Is the attempt to\n",
      "determine the way of man's life so small a matter in your eyes--to\n",

      "You appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about us,\n",
      "Thrasymachus--whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you\n",
      "say you know, is to you a matter of indifference. Prithee, friend,\n",
      "do not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any\n",
      "benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. For my own\n",
      "part I openly declare that I am not convinced, and that I do not believe\n",
      "injustice to be more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled and\n",
      "allowed to have free play. For, granting that there may be an unjust\n",
      "man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force, still this\n",
      "does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice, and there\n",
      "may be others who are in the same predicament with myself. Perhaps we\n",
      "may be wrong; if so, you in your wisdom should convince us that we are\n",
      "mistaken in preferring justice to injustice.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced\n",

      "\n",
      "Heaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or, if you\n",
      "change, change openly and let there be no deception. For I must remark,\n",
      "Thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously said, that although\n",
      "you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense, you did not\n",
      "observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you thought that\n",
      "the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their own\n",
      "good, but like a mere diner or banquetter with a view to the pleasures\n",
      "of the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the market, and not as\n",
      "a shepherd. Yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with\n",
      "the good of his subjects; he has only to provide the best for them,\n",
      "since the perfection of the art is already ensured whenever all the\n",
      "requirements of it are satisfied. And that was what I was saying just\n",
      "now about the ruler. I conceived that the art of the ruler, considered\n",
      "as ruler, whether in a state or in private life, could only regard the\n",
      "good of his flock or subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers\n",
      "in states, that is to say, the true rulers, like being in authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think! Nay, I am sure of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly\n",
      "without payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the\n",
      "advantage not of themselves but of others? Let me ask you a question:\n",
      "Are not the several arts different, by reason of their each having a\n",
      "separate function? And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you\n",
      "think, that we may make a little progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that is the difference, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general\n",
      "one--medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea,\n",
      "and so on?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but we do\n",
      "not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot is\n",
      "to be confused with the art of medicine, because the health of the pilot\n",
      "may be improved by a sea voyage. You would not be inclined to say, would\n",
      "you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to adopt\n",
      "your exact use of language?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not\n",
      "say that the art of payment is medicine?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a\n",
      "man takes fees when he is engaged in healing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially\n",
      "confined to the art?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is to\n",
      "be attributed to something of which they all have the common use?\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is\n",
      "gained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art\n",
      "professed by him?\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave a reluctant assent to this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective\n",
      "arts. But the truth is, that while the art of medicine gives health, and\n",
      "the art of the builder builds a house, another art attends them which\n",
      "is the art of pay. The various arts may be doing their own business and\n",
      "benefiting that over which they preside, but would the artist receive\n",
      "any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well?\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he confers a benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts\n",
      "nor governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before\n",
      "saying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who\n",
      "are the weaker and not the stronger--to their good they attend and\n",
      "not to the good of the superior. And this is the reason, my dear\n",
      "Thrasymachus, why, as I was just now saying, no one is willing to\n",
      "govern; because no one likes to take in hand the reformation of evils\n",
      "which are not his concern without remuneration. For, in the execution of\n",
      "his work, and in giving his orders to another, the true artist does not\n",
      "regard his own interest, but always that of his subjects; and therefore\n",
      "in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they must be paid in one of\n",
      "three modes of payment, money, or honour, or a penalty for refusing.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes of payment\n",
      "are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is I do not understand, or\n",
      "how a penalty can be a payment.\n",
      "\n",
      "You mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to\n",
      "the best men is the great inducement to rule? Of course you know that\n",
      "ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for\n",
      "them; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing\n",
      "and so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves\n",
      "out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being\n",
      "ambitious they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must be\n",
      "laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of\n",
      "punishment. And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness\n",
      "to take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed\n",
      "dishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who\n",
      "refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.\n",
      "And the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,\n",
      "not because they would, but because they cannot help--not under the idea\n",
      "that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as\n",
      "a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling\n",
      "to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good. For there\n",
      "is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men,\n",
      "then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to\n",
      "obtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof that the\n",
      "true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest, but that\n",
      "of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose rather to\n",
      "receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring\n",
      "one. So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that justice is the\n",
      "interest of the stronger. This latter question need not be further\n",
      "discussed at present; but when Thrasymachus says that the life of the\n",
      "unjust is more advantageous than that of the just, his new statement\n",
      "appears to me to be of a far more serious character. Which of us has\n",
      "spoken truly? And which sort of life, Glaucon, do you prefer?\n",
      "\n",
      "I for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous, he\n",
      "answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus was\n",
      "rehearsing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that he\n",
      "is saying what is not true?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most certainly, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, I said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all the\n",
      "advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there must be a\n",
      "numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either side,\n",
      "and in the end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed in our\n",
      "enquiry as we lately did, by making admissions to one another, we shall\n",
      "unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And which method do I understand you to prefer? I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "That which you propose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the beginning and\n",
      "answer me. You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect\n",
      "justice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what is your view about them? Would you call one of them virtue and\n",
      "the other vice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice?\n",
      "\n",
      "What a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirm injustice to\n",
      "be profitable and justice not.\n",
      "\n",
      "What else then would you say?\n",
      "\n",
      "The opposite, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And would you call justice vice?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, I would rather say sublime simplicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then would you call injustice malignity?\n",
      "\n",
      "No; I would rather say discretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly\n",
      "unjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but\n",
      "perhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses. Even this profession\n",
      "if undetected has advantages, though they are not to be compared with\n",
      "those of which I was just now speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus, I\n",
      "replied; but still I cannot hear without amazement that you class\n",
      "injustice with wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly I do so class them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground;\n",
      "for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had\n",
      "been admitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity, an answer\n",
      "might have been given to you on received principles; but now I perceive\n",
      "that you will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust\n",
      "you will attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before\n",
      "to the just, seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with\n",
      "wisdom and virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have guessed most infallibly, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the\n",
      "argument so long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are\n",
      "speaking your real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest\n",
      "and are not amusing yourself at our expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "I may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you?--to refute the\n",
      "argument is your business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so good\n",
      "as answer yet one more question? Does the just man try to gain any\n",
      "advantage over the just?\n",
      "\n",
      "Far otherwise; if he did he would not be the simple amusing creature\n",
      "which he is.\n",
      "\n",
      "And would he try to go beyond just action?\n",
      "\n",
      "He would not.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the\n",
      "unjust; would that be considered by him as just or unjust?\n",
      "\n",
      "He would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he\n",
      "would not be able.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the point. My\n",
      "question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than\n",
      "another just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he would.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what of the unjust--does he claim to have more than the just man and\n",
      "to do more than is just?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, he said, for he claims to have more than all men.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the\n",
      "unjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may put the matter thus, I said--the just does not desire more than\n",
      "his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than\n",
      "both his like and his unlike?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?\n",
      "\n",
      "Good again, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those who are\n",
      "of a certain nature; he who is not, not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of them, I said, is such as his like is?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts:\n",
      "you would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And which is wise and which is foolish?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is foolish.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is\n",
      "foolish?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?\n",

      "to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them, and may be\n",
      "holding many of them in subjection?\n",
      "\n",

      "Yes, certainly.\n",

      "Yes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Well then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder of\n",
      "my repast. For we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser and\n",
      "better and abler than the unjust, and that the unjust are incapable of\n",
      "common action; nay more, that to speak as we did of men who are evil\n",
      "acting at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true, for\n",
      "if they had been perfectly evil, they would have laid hands upon one\n",
      "another; but it is evident that there must have been some remnant of\n",
      "justice in them, which enabled them to combine; if there had not been\n",
      "they would have injured one another as well as their victims; they\n",
      "were but half-villains in their enterprises; for had they been whole\n",
      "villains, and utterly unjust, they would have been utterly incapable of\n",
      "action. That, as I believe, is the truth of the matter, and not what you\n",
      "said at first. But whether the just have a better and happier life than\n",
      "the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to consider. I\n",
      "think that they have, and for the reasons which I have given; but still\n",
      "I should like to examine further, for no light matter is at stake,\n",

      "to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to\n",
      "suffer injustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at\n",
      "a middle point between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as\n",
      "the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do\n",
      "injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit\n",
      "to such an agreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he\n",
      "did. Such is the received account, Socrates, of the nature and origin of\n",
      "justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they\n",
      "have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something\n",
      "of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do\n",
      "what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them;\n",
      "then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be\n",
      "proceeding along the same road, following their interest, which all\n",
      "natures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into the path of\n",
      "justice by the force of law. The liberty which we are supposing may be\n",
      "most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said\n",
      "to have been possessed by Gyges, the ancestor of Croesus the Lydian.\n",
      "According to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd in the service of\n",
      "the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake made an\n",
      "opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock. Amazed\n",
      "at the sight, he descended into the opening, where, among other marvels,\n",
      "he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors, at which he stooping and\n",
      "looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared to him, more than\n",
      "human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; this he took from the\n",
      "finger of the dead and reascended. Now the shepherds met together,\n",
      "according to custom, that they might send their monthly report about the\n",
      "flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the ring on his\n",
      "finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet\n",
      "of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible to the\n",
      "rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no\n",
      "longer present. He was astonished at this, and again touching the ring\n",
      "he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials\n",
      "of the ring, and always with the same result--when he turned the collet\n",
      "inwards he became invisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he\n",
      "contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court;\n",
      "whereas soon as he arrived he seduced the queen, and with her help\n",
      "conspired against the king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose\n",
      "now that there were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of\n",
      "them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an\n",
      "iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his\n",
      "hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he\n",
      "liked out of the market, or go into houses and lie with any one at\n",
      "his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all\n",
      "respects be like a God among men. Then the actions of the just would be\n",
      "as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same\n",
      "point. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is\n",
      "just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him\n",
      "individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks that he\n",
      "can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe in their\n",
      "hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than\n",
      "justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say that they\n",
      "are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming\n",
      "invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he\n",
      "would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although\n",
      "they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances\n",
      "with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.\n",
      "Enough of this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and\n",
      "unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the\n",
      "isolation to be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely\n",
      "unjust, and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from\n",
      "either of them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work\n",
      "of their respective lives. First, let the unjust be like other\n",
      "distinguished masters of craft; like the skilful pilot or physician, who\n",
      "knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits, and who,\n",
      "if he fails at any point, is able to recover himself. So let the unjust\n",
      "make his unjust attempts in the right way, and lie hidden if he means\n",
      "to be great in his injustice: (he who is found out is nobody:) for\n",
      "the highest reach of injustice is, to be deemed just when you are not.\n",
      "Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most\n",
      "perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction, but we must allow\n",
      "him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired the greatest\n",
      "reputation for justice. If he have taken a false step he must be able to\n",
      "recover himself; he must be one who can speak with effect, if any of his\n",
      "deeds come to light, and who can force his way where force is required\n",
      "by his courage and strength, and command of money and friends. And at\n",
      "his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity,\n",
      "wishing, as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. There must be no\n",
      "seeming, for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and\n",
      "then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or\n",
      "for the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be clothed in\n",
      "justice only, and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a\n",
      "state of life the opposite of the former. Let him be the best of men,\n",
      "and let him be thought the worst; then he will have been put to the\n",
      "proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of\n",
      "infamy and its consequences. And let him continue thus to the hour of\n",
      "death; being just and seeming to be unjust. When both have reached the\n",
      "uttermost extreme, the one of justice and the other of injustice, let\n",
      "judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish them\n",
      "up for the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were two\n",
      "statues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do my best, he said. And now that we know what they are like there\n",
      "is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either\n",
      "of them. This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the\n",
      "description a little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that\n",
      "the words which follow are not mine.--Let me put them into the mouths of\n",
      "the eulogists of injustice: They will tell you that the just man who is\n",
      "thought unjust will be scourged, racked, bound--will have his eyes\n",
      "burnt out; and, at last, after suffering every kind of evil, he will be\n",
      "impaled: Then he will understand that he ought to seem only, and not to\n",
      "be, just; the words of Aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust\n",
      "than of the just. For the unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not live\n",
      "with a view to appearances--he wants to be really unjust and not to seem\n",
      "only:--\n",
      "\n",
      "'His mind has a soil deep and fertile, Out of which spring his prudent\n",
      "counsels.'\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, he is thought just, and therefore bears rule in the\n",
      "city; he can marry whom he will, and give in marriage to whom he\n",
      "will; also he can trade and deal where he likes, and always to his own\n",
      "advantage, because he has no misgivings about injustice; and at every\n",
      "contest, whether in public or private, he gets the better of his\n",
      "antagonists, and gains at their expense, and is rich, and out of his\n",
      "gains he can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies; moreover, he\n",
      "can offer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and\n",
      "magnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to\n",
      "honour in a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely\n",
      "to be dearer than they are to the gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and men\n",
      "are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life\n",
      "of the just.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus, his\n",
      "brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there is\n",
      "nothing more to be urged?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, what else is there? I answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, then, according to the proverb, 'Let brother help brother'--if\n",
      "he fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that\n",
      "Glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take\n",
      "from me the power of helping justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonsense, he replied. But let me add something more: There is another\n",
      "side to Glaucon's argument about the praise and censure of justice\n",
      "and injustice, which is equally required in order to bring out what I\n",
      "believe to be his meaning. Parents and tutors are always telling their\n",
      "sons and their wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the sake\n",
      "of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope of\n",
      "obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages,\n",
      "and the like which Glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing\n",
      "to the unjust from the reputation of justice. More, however, is made of\n",
      "appearances by this class of persons than by the others; for they\n",
      "throw in the good opinion of the gods, and will tell you of a shower of\n",
      "benefits which the heavens, as they say, rain upon the pious; and this\n",
      "accords with the testimony of the noble Hesiod and Homer, the first of\n",
      "whom says, that the gods make the oaks of the just--\n",
      "\n",
      "   'To bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle;\n",
      "   And the sheep are bowed down with the weight of their fleeces,'\n",
      "\n",
      "and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. And Homer\n",
      "has a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is--\n",
      "\n",
      "'As the fame of some blameless king who, like a god, Maintains justice;\n",
      "to whom the black earth brings forth Wheat and barley, whose trees are\n",
      "bowed with fruit, And his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives\n",
      "him fish.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Still grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son\n",
      "vouchsafe to the just; they take them down into the world below, where\n",
      "they have the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk,\n",
      "crowned with garlands; their idea seems to be that an immortality of\n",
      "drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue. Some extend their rewards\n",
      "yet further; the posterity, as they say, of the faithful and just shall\n",
      "survive to the third and fourth generation. This is the style in which\n",
      "they praise justice. But about the wicked there is another strain; they\n",
      "bury them in a slough in Hades, and make them carry water in a sieve;\n",
      "also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy, and inflict\n",
      "upon them the punishments which Glaucon described as the portion of the\n",
      "just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does their invention\n",
      "supply. Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the\n",
      "other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of speaking\n",
      "about justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, but\n",
      "is found in prose writers. The universal voice of mankind is always\n",
      "declaring that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and\n",
      "toilsome; and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of\n",
      "attainment, and are only censured by law and opinion. They say also that\n",
      "honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty; and they\n",
      "are quite ready to call wicked men happy, and to honour them both in\n",
      "public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential,\n",
      "while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor, even\n",
      "though acknowledging them to be better than the others. But most\n",
      "extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the\n",
      "gods: they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good\n",
      "men, and good and happiness to the wicked. And mendicant prophets go to\n",
      "rich men's doors and persuade them that they have a power committed\n",
      "to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man's own or his\n",
      "ancestor's sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings and feasts; and\n",
      "they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust, at a small cost;\n",
      "with magic arts and incantations binding heaven, as they say, to execute\n",
      "their will. And the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal, now\n",
      "smoothing the path of vice with the words of Hesiod;--\n",
      "\n",
      "'Vice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth and her\n",
      "dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have set toil,'\n",
      "\n",
      "and a tedious and uphill road: then citing Homer as a witness that the\n",
      "gods may be influenced by men; for he also says:--\n",
      "\n",
      "'The gods, too, may be turned from their purpose; and men pray to them\n",
      "and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by\n",
      "libations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "And they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus,\n",
      "who were children of the Moon and the Muses--that is what they\n",
      "say--according to which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only\n",
      "individuals, but whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin\n",
      "may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and\n",
      "are equally at the service of the living and the dead; the latter sort\n",
      "they call mysteries, and they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if\n",
      "we neglect them no one knows what awaits us.\n",
      "\n",
      "He proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and\n",
      "vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds\n",
      "likely to be affected, my dear Socrates,--those of them, I mean, who are\n",
      "quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from\n",
      "all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of\n",
      "persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would\n",
      "make the best of life? Probably the youth will say to himself in the\n",
      "words of Pindar--\n",
      "\n",
      "'Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower\n",
      "which may be a fortress to me all my days?'\n",
      "\n",
      "For what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also thought\n",
      "just profit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand\n",
      "are unmistakeable. But if, though unjust, I acquire the reputation of\n",
      "justice, a heavenly life is promised to me. Since then, as philosophers\n",
      "prove, appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness, to\n",
      "appearance I must devote myself. I will describe around me a picture and\n",
      "shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house; behind I\n",
      "will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as Archilochus, greatest of sages,\n",
      "recommends. But I hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of\n",
      "wickedness is often difficult; to which I answer, Nothing great is easy.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we would be happy, to be\n",
      "the path along which we should proceed. With a view to concealment we\n",
      "will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs. And there\n",
      "are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and\n",
      "assemblies; and so, partly by persuasion and partly by force, I shall\n",
      "make unlawful gains and not be punished. Still I hear a voice saying\n",
      "that the gods cannot be deceived, neither can they be compelled. But\n",
      "what if there are no gods? or, suppose them to have no care of human\n",
      "things--why in either case should we mind about concealment? And even if\n",
      "there are gods, and they do care about us, yet we know of them only\n",
      "from tradition and the genealogies of the poets; and these are the very\n",
      "persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by 'sacrifices\n",
      "and soothing entreaties and by offerings.' Let us be consistent then,\n",
      "and believe both or neither. If the poets speak truly, why then we had\n",
      "better be unjust, and offer of the fruits of injustice; for if we are\n",
      "just, although we may escape the vengeance of heaven, we shall lose the\n",
      "gains of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we shall keep the gains, and\n",
      "by our sinning and praying, and praying and sinning, the gods will be\n",
      "propitiated, and we shall not be punished. 'But there is a world below\n",
      "in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds.'\n",
      "Yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but there are mysteries and\n",
      "atoning deities, and these have great power. That is what mighty\n",
      "cities declare; and the children of the gods, who were their poets and\n",
      "prophets, bear a like testimony.\n",
      "\n",
      "On what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than\n",
      "the worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful\n",
      "regard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and\n",
      "men, in life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest\n",
      "authorities tell us. Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who\n",
      "has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to\n",
      "honour justice; or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice\n",
      "praised? And even if there should be some one who is able to disprove\n",
      "the truth of my words, and who is satisfied that justice is best, still\n",
      "he is not angry with the unjust, but is very ready to forgive them,\n",
      "because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will;\n",
      "unless, peradventure, there be some one whom the divinity within him may\n",
      "have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or who has attained knowledge\n",
      "of the truth--but no other man. He only blames injustice who, owing to\n",
      "cowardice or age or some weakness, has not the power of being unjust.\n",
      "And this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power, he\n",
      "immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning of\n",
      "the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were to\n",
      "find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice--beginning with\n",
      "the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us, and\n",
      "ending with the men of our own time--no one has ever blamed injustice or\n",
      "praised justice except with a view to the glories, honours, and benefits\n",
      "which flow from them. No one has ever adequately described either in\n",
      "verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in\n",
      "the soul, and invisible to any human or divine eye; or shown that of\n",
      "all the things of a man's soul which he has within him, justice is\n",
      "the greatest good, and injustice the greatest evil. Had this been the\n",
      "universal strain, had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth\n",
      "upwards, we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from\n",
      "doing wrong, but every one would have been his own watchman, because\n",
      "afraid, if he did wrong, of harbouring in himself the greatest of\n",
      "evils. I dare say that Thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the\n",
      "language which I have been merely repeating, and words even stronger\n",
      "than these about justice and injustice, grossly, as I conceive,\n",
      "perverting their true nature. But I speak in this vehement manner, as\n",
      "I must frankly confess to you, because I want to hear from you the\n",
      "opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only the superiority\n",
      "which justice has over injustice, but what effect they have on the\n",
      "possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil\n",
      "to him. And please, as Glaucon requested of you, to exclude reputations;\n",
      "for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and\n",
      "add on the false, we shall say that you do not praise justice, but the\n",
      "appearance of it; we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep\n",
      "injustice dark, and that you really agree with Thrasymachus in thinking\n",
      "that justice is another's good and the interest of the stronger, and\n",
      "that injustice is a man's own profit and interest, though injurious to\n",
      "the weaker. Now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest\n",
      "class of goods which are desired indeed for their results, but in a far\n",
      "greater degree for their own sakes--like sight or hearing or knowledge\n",
      "or health, or any other real and natural and not merely conventional\n",
      "good--I would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point\n",
      "only: I mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice\n",
      "work in the possessors of them. Let others praise justice and censure\n",
      "injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the\n",
      "other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them, I am\n",
      "ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in the\n",
      "consideration of this question, unless I hear the contrary from your own\n",
      "lips, I expect something better. And therefore, I say, not only prove to\n",
      "us that justice is better than injustice, but show what they either of\n",

      "I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but on\n",
      "hearing these words I was quite delighted, and said: Sons of an\n",
      "illustrious father, that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses\n",
      "which the admirer of Glaucon made in honour of you after you had\n",
      "distinguished yourselves at the battle of Megara:--\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sons of Ariston,' he sang, 'divine offspring of an illustrious hero.'\n",
      "\n",
      "The epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine in\n",
      "being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice,\n",
      "and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments. And I do believe that\n",
      "you are not convinced--this I infer from your general character, for had\n",
      "I judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted you. But\n",
      "now, the greater my confidence in you, the greater is my difficulty in\n",
      "knowing what to say. For I am in a strait between two; on the one hand I\n",
      "feel that I am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home to\n",
      "me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which I made\n",
      "to Thrasymachus, proving, as I thought, the superiority which justice\n",
      "has over injustice. And yet I cannot refuse to help, while breath and\n",
      "speech remain to me; I am afraid that there would be an impiety in being\n",
      "present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her\n",
      "defence. And therefore I had best give such help as I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question\n",
      "drop, but to proceed in the investigation. They wanted to arrive at the\n",
      "truth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly,\n",
      "about their relative advantages. I told them, what I really thought,\n",
      "that the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very\n",
      "good eyes. Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think that\n",
      "we had better adopt a method which I may illustrate thus; suppose that\n",
      "a short-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters\n",
      "from a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be\n",
      "found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were\n",
      "larger--if they were the same and he could read the larger letters\n",
      "first, and then proceed to the lesser--this would have been thought a\n",
      "rare piece of good fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to our\n",
      "enquiry?\n",
      "\n",
      "I will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our\n",
      "enquiry, is, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an\n",
      "individual, and sometimes as the virtue of a State.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is not a State larger than an individual?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and\n",
      "more easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the\n",
      "nature of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and\n",
      "secondly in the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser\n",
      "and comparing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, he said, is an excellent proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the\n",
      "justice and injustice of the State in process of creation also.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dare say.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of our\n",
      "search will be more easily discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, far more easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "But ought we to attempt to construct one? I said; for to do so, as I am\n",
      "inclined to think, will be a very serious task. Reflect therefore.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have reflected, said Adeimantus, and am anxious that you should\n",
      "proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "A State, I said, arises, as I conceive, out of the needs of mankind;\n",
      "no one is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants. Can any other\n",
      "origin of a State be imagined?\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be no other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply them,\n",
      "one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and when\n",
      "these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the\n",
      "body of inhabitants is termed a State.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another receives,\n",
      "under the idea that the exchange will be for their good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the true\n",
      "creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the\n",
      "condition of life and existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the like.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great\n",
      "demand: We may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder,\n",
      "some one else a weaver--shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps\n",
      "some other purveyor to our bodily wants?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite right.\n",
      "\n",
      "The barest notion of a State must include four or five men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how will they proceed? Will each bring the result of his labours\n",
      "into a common stock?--the individual husbandman, for example, producing\n",
      "for four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the\n",
      "provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself;\n",
      "or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of\n",
      "producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food\n",
      "in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his time\n",
      "be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no\n",
      "partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?\n",
      "\n",
      "Adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at\n",
      "producing everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably, I replied, that would be the better way; and when I hear you\n",
      "say this, I am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there\n",
      "are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different\n",
      "occupations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will you have a work better done when the workman has many\n",
      "occupations, or when he has only one?\n",
      "\n",
      "When he has only one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at\n",
      "the right time?\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "For business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is\n",
      "at leisure; but the doer must follow up what he is doing, and make the\n",
      "business his first object.\n",
      "\n",
      "He must.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully\n",
      "and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is\n",
      "natural to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman will\n",
      "not make his own plough or mattock, or other implements of agriculture,\n",
      "if they are to be good for anything. Neither will the builder make\n",
      "his tools--and he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and\n",
      "shoemaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers in\n",
      "our little State, which is already beginning to grow?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, in order\n",
      "that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as well\n",
      "as husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers fleeces\n",
      "and hides,--still our State will not be very large.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is true; yet neither will it be a very small State which contains\n",
      "all these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, again, there is the situation of the city--to find a place where\n",
      "nothing need be imported is wellnigh impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required\n",
      "supply from another city?\n",
      "\n",
      "There must.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require\n",
      "who would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for\n",
      "themselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate\n",
      "those from whom their wants are supplied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?\n",
      "\n",
      "They will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we shall want merchants?\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors will\n",
      "also be needed, and in considerable numbers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, in considerable numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?\n",
      "To secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our\n",
      "principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a\n",
      "State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly they will buy and sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes of\n",
      "exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production\n",
      "to market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with\n",
      "him,--is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake\n",
      "the office of salesmen. In well-ordered states they are commonly those\n",
      "who are the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for\n",
      "any other purpose; their duty is to be in the market, and to give money\n",
      "in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from\n",
      "those who desire to buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our State. Is\n",
      "not 'retailer' the term which is applied to those who sit in the\n",
      "market-place engaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from\n",
      "one city to another are called merchants?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly\n",
      "on the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily strength\n",
      "for labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if I do not\n",
      "mistake, hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the price of\n",
      "their labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then hirelings will help to make up our population?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of the\n",
      "State did they spring up?\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another. I cannot\n",
      "imagine that they are more likely to be found any where else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dare say that you are right in your suggestion, I said; we had better\n",
      "think the matter out, and not shrink from the enquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of life,\n",
      "now that we have thus established them. Will they not produce corn, and\n",
      "wine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves? And\n",
      "when they are housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and\n",
      "barefoot, but in winter substantially clothed and shod. They will feed\n",
      "on barley-meal and flour of wheat, baking and kneading them, making\n",
      "noble cakes and loaves; these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on\n",
      "clean leaves, themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew\n",
      "or myrtle. And they and their children will feast, drinking of the wine\n",
      "which they have made, wearing garlands on their heads, and hymning the\n",
      "praises of the gods, in happy converse with one another. And they will\n",
      "take care that their families do not exceed their means; having an eye\n",
      "to poverty or war.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, said Glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish to\n",
      "their meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, I replied, I had forgotten; of course they must have a\n",
      "relish--salt, and olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs\n",
      "such as country people prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs,\n",
      "and peas, and beans; and they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns\n",
      "at the fire, drinking in moderation. And with such a diet they may be\n",
      "expected to live in peace and health to a good old age, and bequeath a\n",
      "similar life to their children after them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of pigs,\n",
      "how else would you feed the beasts?\n",
      "\n",
      "But what would you have, Glaucon? I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life.\n",
      "People who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and\n",
      "dine off tables, and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern\n",
      "style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, now I understand: the question which you would have me\n",
      "consider is, not only how a State, but how a luxurious State is created;\n",
      "and possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a State we shall be\n",
      "more likely to see how justice and injustice originate. In my opinion\n",
      "the true and healthy constitution of the State is the one which I have\n",
      "described. But if you wish also to see a State at fever-heat, I have\n",
      "no objection. For I suspect that many will not be satisfied with the\n",
      "simpler way of life. They will be for adding sofas, and tables,\n",
      "and other furniture; also dainties, and perfumes, and incense, and\n",
      "courtesans, and cakes, all these not of one sort only, but in every\n",
      "variety; we must go beyond the necessaries of which I was at first\n",
      "speaking, such as houses, and clothes, and shoes: the arts of the\n",
      "painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion, and gold and\n",
      "ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy State is\n",
      "no longer sufficient. Now will the city have to fill and swell with a\n",
      "multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want; such\n",
      "as the whole tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class\n",
      "have to do with forms and colours; another will be the votaries of\n",
      "music--poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists, players, dancers,\n",
      "contractors; also makers of divers kinds of articles, including women's\n",
      "dresses. And we shall want more servants. Will not tutors be also in\n",
      "request, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well as\n",
      "confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed and\n",
      "therefore had no place in the former edition of our State, but are\n",
      "needed now? They must not be forgotten: and there will be animals of\n",
      "many other kinds, if people eat them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians\n",
      "than before?\n",
      "\n",
      "Much greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants\n",
      "will be too small now, and not enough?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a slice of our neighbours' land will be wanted by us for pasture\n",
      "and tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves,\n",
      "they exceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the\n",
      "unlimited accumulation of wealth?\n",
      "\n",
      "That, Socrates, will be inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we shall go to war, Glaucon. Shall we not?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most certainly, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm, thus much\n",
      "we may affirm, that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes\n",
      "which are also the causes of almost all the evils in States, private as\n",
      "well as public.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And our State must once more enlarge; and this time the enlargement will\n",
      "be nothing short of a whole army, which will have to go out and fight\n",
      "with the invaders for all that we have, as well as for the things and\n",
      "persons whom we were describing above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why? he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, I said; not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged\n",
      "by all of us when we were framing the State: the principle, as you will\n",
      "remember, was that one man cannot practise many arts with success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is not war an art?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be a husbandman, or a weaver,\n",
      "or a builder--in order that we might have our shoes well made; but to\n",
      "him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by\n",
      "nature fitted, and at that he was to continue working all his life long\n",
      "and at no other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and then he would\n",
      "become a good workman. Now nothing can be more important than that\n",
      "the work of a soldier should be well done. But is war an art so easily\n",
      "acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman, or\n",
      "shoemaker, or other artisan; although no one in the world would be a\n",
      "good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation,\n",
      "and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing\n",
      "else? No tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence,\n",
      "nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and has\n",
      "never bestowed any attention upon them. How then will he who takes up\n",
      "a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day,\n",
      "whether with heavy-armed or any other kind of troops?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would be\n",
      "beyond price.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the higher the duties of the guardian, I said, the more time, and\n",
      "skill, and art, and application will be needed by him?\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted\n",
      "for the task of guarding the city?\n",
      "\n",
      "It will.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the selection will be no easy matter, I said; but we must be brave\n",
      "and do our best.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to overtake\n",

      "him, they have to fight with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog\n",

      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another,\n",
      "and with everybody else?\n",

      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "He will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two\n",
      "qualities; and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible; and\n",
      "hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.\n",

      "Here feeling perplexed I began to think over what had preceded.--My\n",

      "What do you mean? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite\n",
      "qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "And where do you find them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Many animals, I replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the dog\n",

      "their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our\n",
      "finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited\n",

      "\n",
      "I do not apprehend your meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trait of which I am speaking, I replied, may be also seen in the\n",
      "dog, and is remarkable in the animal.\n",
      "\n",
      "What trait?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance,\n",
      "he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor the\n",
      "other any good. Did this never strike you as curious?\n",
      "\n",
      "The matter never struck me before; but I quite recognise the truth of\n",
      "your remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "And surely this instinct of the dog is very charming;--your dog is a\n",
      "true philosopher.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only\n",
      "by the criterion of knowing and not knowing. And must not an animal be a\n",
      "lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test\n",
      "of knowledge and ignorance?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most assuredly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?\n",
      "\n",
      "They are the same, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be\n",
      "gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of\n",
      "wisdom and knowledge?\n",
      "\n",
      "That we may safely affirm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State will\n",

      "Undoubtedly.\n",

      "Then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found them,\n",
      "how are they to be reared and educated? Is not this an enquiry which\n",
      "may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final\n",
      "end--How do justice and injustice grow up in States? for we do not want\n",
      "either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an\n",

      "\n",
      "Adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us.\n",

      "\n",
      "True.\n",

      "\n",
      "You know, I said, that we begin by telling children stories which,\n",

      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",

      "\n",
      "You know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work,\n",

      "more readily taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales\n",
      "which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds\n",
      "ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish\n",
      "them to have when they are grown up?\n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of\n",

      "children the authorised ones only. Let them fashion the mind with such\n",

      "You may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; for they are\n",

      "Very likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would term\n",

      "\n",
      "A fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, and,\n",
      "what is more, a bad lie.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when is this fault committed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and\n",
      "heroes,--as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a\n",
      "likeness to the original.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blameable; but what\n",
      "are the stories which you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies in high\n",
      "places, which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie\n",
      "too,--I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated\n",
      "on him. The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son\n",
      "inflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be\n",
      "lightly told to young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had\n",
      "better be buried in silence. But if there is an absolute necessity\n",
      "for their mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery, and\n",
      "they should sacrifice not a common (Eleusinian) pig, but some huge and\n",
      "unprocurable victim; and then the number of the hearers will be very few\n",
      "indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State; the\n",
      "young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he\n",
      "is far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises his\n",
      "father when he does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following\n",
      "the example of the first and greatest among the gods.\n",
      "\n",
      "I entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are\n",
      "quite unfit to be repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of\n",
      "quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should\n",
      "any word be said to them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and\n",
      "fightings of the gods against one another, for they are not true. No,\n",
      "we shall never mention the battles of the giants, or let them be\n",
      "embroidered on garments; and we shall be silent about the innumerable\n",
      "other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives.\n",
      "If they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling\n",
      "is unholy, and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel\n",
      "between citizens; this is what old men and old women should begin by\n",
      "telling children; and when they grow up, the poets also should be told\n",
      "to compose for them in a similar spirit. But the narrative of Hephaestus\n",
      "binding Here his mother, or how on another occasion Zeus sent him flying\n",
      "for taking her part when she was being beaten, and all the battles of\n",
      "the gods in Homer--these tales must not be admitted into our State,\n",
      "whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not. For\n",
      "a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal;\n",
      "anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become\n",
      "indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important that the\n",
      "tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "There you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such\n",

      "answer him?\n",
      "\n",
      "I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets,\n",

      "\n",
      "Very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you mean?\n",
      "\n",

      "which the representation is given.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right.\n",

      "\n",

      "Yes.\n",

      "\n",
      "Assuredly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many\n",
      "assert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most things\n",
      "that occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and many are the\n",

      "\n",

      "to come?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union\n",
      "of the two?\n",
      "\n",
      "That again, he said, I do not quite understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fear that I must be a ridiculous teacher when I have so much\n",
      "difficulty in making myself apprehended. Like a bad speaker, therefore,\n",
      "I will not take the whole of the subject, but will break a piece off in\n",
      "illustration of my meaning. You know the first lines of the Iliad,\n",
      "in which the poet says that Chryses prayed Agamemnon to release his\n",
      "daughter, and that Agamemnon flew into a passion with him; whereupon\n",
      "Chryses, failing of his object, invoked the anger of the God against the\n",
      "Achaeans. Now as far as these lines,\n",
      "\n",
      "'And he prayed all the Greeks, but especially the two sons of Atreus,\n",
      "the chiefs of the people,'\n",
      "\n",
      "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose\n",
      "that he is any one else. But in what follows he takes the person of\n",
      "Chryses, and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the\n",
      "speaker is not Homer, but the aged priest himself. And in this double\n",
      "form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at\n",
      "Troy and in Ithaca and throughout the Odyssey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites\n",
      "from time to time and in the intermediate passages?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that\n",
      "he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you,\n",
      "is going to speak?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice\n",
      "or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by\n",
      "way of imitation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then\n",
      "again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration.\n",
      "However, in order that I may make my meaning quite clear, and that you\n",
      "may no more say, 'I don't understand,' I will show how the change might\n",
      "be effected. If Homer had said, 'The priest came, having his daughter's\n",
      "ransom in his hands, supplicating the Achaeans, and above all the\n",
      "kings;' and then if, instead of speaking in the person of Chryses,\n",
      "he had continued in his own person, the words would have been, not\n",
      "imitation, but simple narration. The passage would have run as follows\n",
      "(I am no poet, and therefore I drop the metre), 'The priest came and\n",
      "prayed the gods on behalf of the Greeks that they might capture Troy\n",
      "and return safely home, but begged that they would give him back his\n",
      "daughter, and take the ransom which he brought, and respect the God.\n",
      "Thus he spoke, and the other Greeks revered the priest and assented. But\n",
      "Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him depart and not come again, lest the\n",
      "staff and chaplets of the God should be of no avail to him--the daughter\n",
      "of Chryses should not be released, he said--she should grow old with him\n",
      "in Argos. And then he told him to go away and not to provoke him, if he\n",
      "intended to get home unscathed. And the old man went away in fear and\n",
      "silence, and, when he had left the camp, he called upon Apollo by his\n",
      "many names, reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to\n",
      "him, whether in building his temples, or in offering sacrifice, and\n",
      "praying that his good deeds might be returned to him, and that the\n",
      "Achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god,'--and so on.\n",
      "In this way the whole becomes simple narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or you may suppose the opposite case--that the intermediate passages are\n",
      "omitted, and the dialogue only left.\n",
      "\n",
      "That also, he said, I understand; you mean, for example, as in tragedy.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if I mistake not, what you\n",
      "failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you, that poetry and\n",
      "mythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative--instances of this are\n",
      "supplied by tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite style,\n",
      "in which the poet is the only speaker--of this the dithyramb affords\n",
      "the best example; and the combination of both is found in epic, and in\n",
      "several other styles of poetry. Do I take you with me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; I see now what you meant.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will ask you to remember also what I began by saying, that we had done\n",
      "with the subject and might proceed to the style.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "In saying this, I intended to imply that we must come to an\n",
      "understanding about the mimetic art,--whether the poets, in narrating\n",
      "their stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether\n",
      "in whole or in part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all\n",
      "imitation be prohibited?\n",
      "\n",
      "You mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted\n",
      "into our State?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; but there may be more than this in question: I really do\n",
      "not know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.\n",
      "\n",
      "And go we will, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be\n",
      "imitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule\n",
      "already laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not many;\n",
      "and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fail of gaining much\n",
      "reputation in any?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many\n",
      "things as well as he would imitate a single one?\n",
      "\n",
      "He cannot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life,\n",
      "and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as\n",
      "well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied, the same\n",
      "persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers of tragedy\n",
      "and comedy--did you not just now call them imitations?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot\n",
      "succeed in both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things are\n",
      "but imitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are so.\n",
      "\n",
      "And human nature, Adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet\n",
      "smaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well, as\n",
      "of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "If then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that\n",
      "our guardians, setting aside every other business, are to dedicate\n",
      "themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the State, making\n",
      "this their craft, and engaging in no work which does not bear on this\n",
      "end, they ought not to practise or imitate anything else; if they\n",
      "imitate at all, they should imitate from youth upward only those\n",
      "characters which are suitable to their profession--the courageous,\n",
      "temperate, holy, free, and the like; but they should not depict or be\n",
      "skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness, lest from\n",
      "imitation they should come to be what they imitate. Did you never\n",
      "observe how imitations, beginning in early youth and continuing far into\n",
      "life, at length grow into habits and become a second nature, affecting\n",
      "body, voice, and mind?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, certainly, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of\n",
      "whom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether\n",
      "young or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting\n",
      "against the gods in conceit of her happiness, or when she is in\n",
      "affliction, or sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who is in\n",
      "sickness, love, or labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very right, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the\n",
      "offices of slaves?\n",
      "\n",
      "They must not.\n",
      "\n",
      "And surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the\n",
      "reverse of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or\n",
      "revile one another in drink or out of drink, or who in any other manner\n",
      "sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed, as the\n",
      "manner of such is. Neither should they be trained to imitate the action\n",
      "or speech of men or women who are mad or bad; for madness, like vice, is\n",
      "to be known but not to be practised or imitated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or\n",
      "boatswains, or the like?\n",
      "\n",
      "How can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to\n",
      "the callings of any of these?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls, the\n",
      "murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort of\n",
      "thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the\n",
      "behaviour of madmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "You mean, I said, if I understand you aright, that there is one sort of\n",
      "narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has\n",
      "anything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man of an\n",
      "opposite character and education.\n",
      "\n",
      "And which are these two sorts? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose, I answered, that a just and good man in the course of a\n",
      "narration comes on some saying or action of another good man,--I should\n",
      "imagine that he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of\n",
      "this sort of imitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the\n",
      "good man when he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when\n",
      "he is overtaken by illness or love or drink, or has met with any other\n",
      "disaster. But when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him, he\n",
      "will not make a study of that; he will disdain such a person, and will\n",
      "assume his likeness, if at all, for a moment only when he is performing\n",
      "some good action; at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which\n",
      "he has never practised, nor will he like to fashion and frame himself\n",
      "after the baser models; he feels the employment of such an art, unless\n",
      "in jest, to be beneath him, and his mind revolts at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I should expect, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated\n",
      "out of Homer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and\n",
      "narrative; but there will be very little of the former, and a great deal\n",
      "of the latter. Do you agree?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker must\n",
      "necessarily take.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is another sort of character who will narrate anything, and,\n",
      "the worse he is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will be too\n",
      "bad for him: and he will be ready to imitate anything, not as a joke,\n",
      "but in right good earnest, and before a large company. As I was just now\n",
      "saying, he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder, the noise of\n",
      "wind and hail, or the creaking of wheels, and pulleys, and the various\n",
      "sounds of flutes, pipes, trumpets, and all sorts of instruments: he will\n",
      "bark like a dog, bleat like a sheep, or crow like a cock; his entire art\n",
      "will consist in imitation of voice and gesture, and there will be very\n",
      "little narration.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, he said, will be his mode of speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "These, then, are the two kinds of style?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has\n",
      "but slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen\n",
      "for their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if he speaks\n",
      "correctly, is always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep\n",
      "within the limits of a single harmony (for the changes are not great),\n",
      "and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?\n",
      "\n",
      "That is quite true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of\n",
      "rhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the style\n",
      "has all sorts of changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is also perfectly true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all\n",
      "poetry, and every form of expression in words? No one can say anything\n",
      "except in one or other of them or in both together.\n",
      "\n",
      "They include all, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And shall we receive into our State all the three styles, or one only of\n",
      "the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: and\n",
      "indeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by you,\n",
      "is the most popular style with children and their attendants, and with\n",
      "the world in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not deny it.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our\n",
      "State, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man\n",
      "plays one part only?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; quite unsuitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we\n",
      "shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a\n",
      "husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a\n",
      "soldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so\n",
      "clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a proposal\n",
      "to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship him as\n",
      "a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also inform him that\n",
      "in our State such as he are not permitted to exist; the law will not\n",
      "allow them. And so when we have anointed him with myrrh, and set a\n",
      "garland of wool upon his head, we shall send him away to another city.\n",
      "For we mean to employ for our souls' health the rougher and severer poet\n",
      "or story-teller, who will imitate the style of the virtuous only, and\n",
      "will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the\n",
      "education of our soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We certainly will, he said, if we have the power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then now, my friend, I said, that part of music or literary education\n",
      "which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished; for\n",
      "the matter and manner have both been discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think so too, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next in order will follow melody and song.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is obvious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we are to\n",
      "be consistent with ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fear, said Glaucon, laughing, that the word 'every one' hardly\n",
      "includes me, for I cannot at the moment say what they should be; though\n",
      "I may guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts--the words,\n",
      "the melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge I may presuppose?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; so much as that you may.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as for the words, there will surely be no difference between words\n",
      "which are and which are not set to music; both will conform to the same\n",
      "laws, and these have been already determined by us?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?\n",

      "Certainly.\n",

      "We were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no need\n",
      "of lamentation and strains of sorrow?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow? You are musical, and\n",
      "can tell me.\n",
      "\n",
      "The harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor Lydian, and the\n",
      "full-toned or bass Lydian, and such like.\n",
      "\n",
      "These then, I said, must be banished; even to women who have a character\n",
      "to maintain they are of no use, and much less to men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly\n",
      "unbecoming the character of our guardians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Utterly unbecoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "And which are the soft or drinking harmonies?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they are termed 'relaxed.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, and are these of any military use?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite the reverse, he replied; and if so the Dorian and the Phrygian are\n",
      "the only ones which you have left.\n",
      "\n",
      "I answered: Of the harmonies I know nothing, but I want to have one\n",
      "warlike, to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the\n",
      "hour of danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing, and he\n",
      "is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil, and\n",
      "at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a\n",
      "determination to endure; and another to be used by him in times of peace\n",
      "and freedom of action, when there is no pressure of necessity, and he is\n",
      "seeking to persuade God by prayer, or man by instruction and admonition,\n",
      "or on the other hand, when he is expressing his willingness to yield to\n",
      "persuasion or entreaty or admonition, and which represents him when\n",
      "by prudent conduct he has attained his end, not carried away by his\n",
      "success, but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances, and\n",
      "acquiescing in the event. These two harmonies I ask you to leave;\n",
      "the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom, the strain of the\n",
      "unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate, the strain of courage, and\n",
      "the strain of temperance; these, I say, leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "And these, he replied, are the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies of which I\n",
      "was just now speaking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs and\n",
      "melodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic\n",
      "scale?\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three\n",
      "corners and complex scales, or the makers of any other many-stringed\n",
      "curiously-harmonised instruments?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players? Would you admit\n",
      "them into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of\n",
      "harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put\n",
      "together; even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "There remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city, and\n",
      "the shepherds may have a pipe in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preferring of Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his\n",
      "instruments is not at all strange, I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not at all, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, by the dog of Egypt, we have been unconsciously purging the\n",
      "State, which not long ago we termed luxurious.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we have done wisely, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then let us now finish the purgation, I said. Next in order to\n",
      "harmonies, rhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to\n",
      "the same rules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre,\n",
      "or metres of every kind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the\n",
      "expressions of a courageous and harmonious life; and when we have found\n",
      "them, we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like\n",
      "spirit, not the words to the foot and melody. To say what these rhythms\n",
      "are will be your duty--you must teach me them, as you have already\n",
      "taught me the harmonies.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, indeed, he replied, I cannot tell you. I only know that there\n",
      "are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are\n",
      "framed, just as in sounds there are four notes (i.e. the four notes of\n",
      "the tetrachord.) out of which all the harmonies are composed; that is\n",
      "an observation which I have made. But of what sort of lives they are\n",
      "severally the imitations I am unable to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I said, we must take Damon into our counsels; and he will tell us\n",
      "what rhythms are expressive of meanness, or insolence, or fury, or other\n",
      "unworthiness, and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite\n",
      "feelings. And I think that I have an indistinct recollection of his\n",
      "mentioning a complex Cretic rhythm; also a dactylic or heroic, and he\n",
      "arranged them in some manner which I do not quite understand, making\n",
      "the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot, long and short\n",
      "alternating; and, unless I am mistaken, he spoke of an iambic as well\n",
      "as of a trochaic rhythm, and assigned to them short and long quantities.\n",
      "Also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the\n",
      "foot quite as much as the rhythm; or perhaps a combination of the two;\n",
      "for I am not certain what he meant. These matters, however, as I was\n",
      "saying, had better be referred to Damon himself, for the analysis of\n",
      "the subject would be difficult, you know? (Socrates expresses himself\n",
      "carelessly in accordance with his assumed ignorance of the details of\n",
      "the subject. In the first part of the sentence he appears to be speaking\n",
      "of paeonic rhythms which are in the ratio of 3/2; in the second part, of\n",
      "dactylic and anapaestic rhythms, which are in the ratio of 1/1; in the\n",
      "last clause, of iambic and trochaic rhythms, which are in the ratio of\n",
      "1/2 or 2/1.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Rather so, I should say.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace\n",
      "is an effect of good or bad rhythm.\n",
      "\n",
      "None at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "And also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad\n",
      "style; and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style; for our\n",
      "principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words, and not\n",
      "the words by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so, he said, they should follow the words.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will not the words and the character of the style depend on the\n",
      "temper of the soul?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And everything else on the style?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on\n",
      "simplicity,--I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered\n",
      "mind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism\n",
      "for folly?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make these\n",

      "They must.\n",
      "\n",
      "And surely the art of the painter and every other creative and\n",
      "constructive art are full of them,--weaving, embroidery, architecture,\n",
      "and every kind of manufacture; also nature, animal and vegetable,--in\n",
      "all of them there is grace or the absence of grace. And ugliness and\n",
      "discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill\n",
      "nature, as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue\n",
      "and bear their likeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is quite true, he said.\n",

      "be required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on\n",
      "pain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our State? Or is the\n",
      "same control to be extended to other artists, and are they also to be\n",
      "prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance\n",
      "and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other\n",

      "prevented from practising his art in our State, lest the taste of our\n",

      "browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day, little\n",
      "by little, until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption\n",
      "in their own soul. Let our artists rather be those who are gifted to\n",

      "receive the good in everything; and beauty, the effluence of fair works,\n",
      "shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving breeze from a\n",

      "\n",
      "And therefore, I said, Glaucon, musical training is a more potent\n",
      "instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way\n",
      "into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten,\n",
      "imparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated\n",
      "graceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because\n",
      "he who has received this true education of the inner being will most\n",
      "shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature, and with a true\n",
      "taste, while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the\n",
      "good, and becomes noble and good, he will justly blame and hate the bad,\n",
      "now in the days of his youth, even before he is able to know the reason\n",

      "whom his education has made him long familiar.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Just as in learning to read, I said, we were satisfied when we knew\n",
      "the letters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring\n",
      "sizes and combinations; not slighting them as unimportant whether they\n",
      "occupy a space large or small, but everywhere eager to make them out;\n",

      "kindred, as well as the contrary forms, in all their combinations,\n",
      "and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found, not\n",
      "slighting them either in small things or great, but believing them all\n",
      "to be within the sphere of one art and study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most assuredly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form, and the two\n",

      "\n",
      "I perceive, I said, that you have or have had experiences of this sort,\n",

      "any affinity to temperance?\n",
      "\n",
      "How can that be? he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use of his\n",

      "\n",
      "Or any affinity to virtue in general?\n",
      "\n",

      "harmonious?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the\n",
      "lover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it if their\n",
      "love is of the right sort?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, indeed, Socrates, it must never come near them.\n",
      "\n",

      "purpose, and he must first have the other's consent; and this rule is\n",
      "to limit him in all his intercourse, and he is never to be seen going\n",
      "further, or, if he exceeds, he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and\n",
      "bad taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "I quite agree, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the\n",
      "end of music if not the love of beauty?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "After music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be trained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the training\n",
      "in it should be careful and should continue through life. Now my belief\n",
      "is,--and this is a matter upon which I should like to have your opinion\n",
      "in confirmation of my own, but my own belief is,--not that the good body\n",
      "by any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that\n",
      "the good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this\n",
      "may be possible. What do you say?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in handing\n",

      "prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "That they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by\n",
      "us; for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and\n",
      "not know where in the world he is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to take\n",
      "care of him is ridiculous indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training\n",
      "for the great contest of all--are they not?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am afraid, I said, that a habit of body such as they have is but a\n",
      "sleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health. Do you not observe\n",
      "that these athletes sleep away their lives, and are liable to most\n",
      "dangerous illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a degree, from\n",
      "their customary regimen?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I said, a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior\n",
      "athletes, who are to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with the\n",
      "utmost keenness; amid the many changes of water and also of food, of\n",
      "summer heat and winter cold, which they will have to endure when on a\n",
      "campaign, they must not be liable to break down in health.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is my view.\n",
      "\n",
      "The really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which\n",
      "we were just now describing.\n",
      "\n",
      "How so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, I conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our music, is\n",
      "simple and good; and especially the military gymnastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "My meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at\n",
      "their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers' fare; they have\n",
      "no fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and they\n",
      "are not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most\n",
      "convenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire,\n",
      "and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere\n",
      "mentioned in Homer. In proscribing them, however, he is not singular;\n",
      "all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good\n",
      "condition should take nothing of the kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite right in not taking them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you would not approve of Syracusan dinners, and the refinements of\n",
      "Sicilian cookery?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think not.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought, of\n",

      "those who would profess to have had a liberal education? Is it not\n",
      "disgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, and I do not believe that there were any such diseases in\n",
      "the days of Asclepius; and this I infer from the circumstance that the\n",
      "hero Eurypylus, after he has been wounded in Homer, drinks a posset of\n",
      "Pramnian wine well besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese, which\n",
      "are certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons of Asclepius who were\n",
      "at the Trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink, or\n",
      "rebuke Patroclus, who is treating his case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a\n",
      "person in his condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so extraordinary, I replied, if you bear in mind that in former\n",
      "days, as is commonly said, before the time of Herodicus, the guild of\n",
      "Asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine, which may be\n",
      "said to educate diseases. But Herodicus, being a trainer, and himself of\n",
      "a sickly constitution, by a combination of training and doctoring found\n",
      "out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself, and secondly the rest\n",
      "of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "How was that? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the invention of lingering death; for he had a mortal disease which\n",
      "he perpetually tended, and as recovery was out of the question, he\n",
      "passed his entire life as a valetudinarian; he could do nothing but\n",
      "attend upon himself, and he was in constant torment whenever he departed\n",
      "in anything from his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by the help of\n",
      "science he struggled on to old age.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rare reward of his skill!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; a reward which a man might fairly expect who never\n",
      "understood that, if Asclepius did not instruct his descendants\n",
      "in valetudinarian arts, the omission arose, not from ignorance or\n",
      "inexperience of such a branch of medicine, but because he knew that in\n",
      "all well-ordered states every individual has an occupation to which he\n",
      "must attend, and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being\n",
      "ill. This we remark in the case of the artisan, but, ludicrously enough,\n",
      "do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you mean? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean this: When a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough\n",
      "and ready cure; an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife,--these\n",
      "are his remedies. And if some one prescribes for him a course of\n",
      "dietetics, and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head, and\n",
      "all that sort of thing, he replies at once that he has no time to be\n",
      "ill, and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing\n",
      "his disease to the neglect of his customary employment; and therefore\n",
      "bidding good-bye to this sort of physician, he resumes his ordinary\n",
      "habits, and either gets well and lives and does his business, or, if his\n",
      "constitution fails, he dies and has no more trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of\n",
      "medicine thus far only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Has he not, I said, an occupation; and what profit would there be in his\n",
      "life if he were deprived of his occupation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with the rich man this is otherwise; of him we do not say that he\n",
      "has any specially appointed work which he must perform, if he would\n",
      "live.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is generally supposed to have nothing to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you never heard of the saying of Phocylides, that as soon as a man\n",
      "has a livelihood he should practise virtue?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, he said, I think that he had better begin somewhat sooner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us not have a dispute with him about this, I said; but rather ask\n",
      "ourselves: Is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man, or\n",
      "can he live without it? And if obligatory on him, then let us raise\n",
      "a further question, whether this dieting of disorders, which is an\n",
      "impediment to the application of the mind in carpentering and the\n",
      "mechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of\n",
      "Phocylides?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of the\n",
      "body, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical to\n",
      "the practice of virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, indeed, I replied, and equally incompatible with the management of\n",
      "a house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important\n",
      "of all, irreconcileable with any kind of study or thought or\n",
      "self-reflection--there is a constant suspicion that headache and\n",
      "giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy, and hence all practising or\n",
      "making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped; for\n",
      "a man is always fancying that he is being made ill, and is in constant\n",
      "anxiety about the state of his body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, likely enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore our politic Asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited\n",
      "the power of his art only to persons who, being generally of healthy\n",
      "constitution and habits of life, had a definite ailment; such as these\n",
      "he cured by purges and operations, and bade them live as usual, herein\n",
      "consulting the interests of the State; but bodies which disease had\n",
      "penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure\n",
      "by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion: he did not want to\n",
      "lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or to have weak fathers begetting\n",
      "weaker sons;--if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he\n",
      "had no business to cure him; for such a cure would have been of no use\n",
      "either to himself, or to the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, he said, you regard Asclepius as a statesman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly; and his character is further illustrated by his sons. Note that\n",
      "they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which\n",
      "I am speaking at the siege of Troy: You will remember how, when Pandarus\n",
      "wounded Menelaus, they\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sucked the blood out of the wound, and sprinkled soothing remedies,'\n",
      "\n",
      "but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or\n",
      "drink in the case of Menelaus, any more than in the case of Eurypylus;\n",
      "the remedies, as they conceived, were enough to heal any man who before\n",
      "he was wounded was healthy and regular in his habits; and even though he\n",
      "did happen to drink a posset of Pramnian wine, he might get well all the\n",
      "same. But they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate\n",
      "subjects, whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others; the\n",
      "art of medicine was not designed for their good, and though they were as\n",
      "rich as Midas, the sons of Asclepius would have declined to attend them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were very acute persons, those sons of Asclepius.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally so, I replied. Nevertheless, the tragedians and Pindar\n",
      "disobeying our behests, although they acknowledge that Asclepius was the\n",
      "son of Apollo, say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man\n",
      "who was at the point of death, and for this reason he was struck by\n",
      "lightning. But we, in accordance with the principle already affirmed by\n",
      "us, will not believe them when they tell us both;--if he was the son of\n",
      "a god, we maintain that he was not avaricious; or, if he was avaricious,\n",
      "he was not the son of a god.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that, Socrates, is excellent; but I should like to put a question to\n",
      "you: Ought there not to be good physicians in a State, and are not the\n",
      "best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good\n",
      "and bad? and are not the best judges in like manner those who are\n",
      "acquainted with all sorts of moral natures?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, I too would have good judges and good physicians. But do\n",
      "you know whom I think good?\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you tell me?\n",
      "\n",
      "I will, if I can. Let me however note that in the same question you join\n",
      "two things which are not the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "How so? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, I said, you join physicians and judges. Now the most skilful\n",
      "physicians are those who, from their youth upwards, have combined with\n",
      "the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease; they\n",
      "had better not be robust in health, and should have had all manner of\n",
      "diseases in their own persons. For the body, as I conceive, is not the\n",
      "instrument with which they cure the body; in that case we could not\n",
      "allow them ever to be or to have been sickly; but they cure the body\n",
      "with the mind, and the mind which has become and is sick can cure\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind; he\n",
      "ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and to\n",
      "have associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone through\n",
      "the whole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly infer\n",
      "the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own\n",
      "self-consciousness; the honourable mind which is to form a healthy\n",
      "judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits\n",
      "when young. And this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to\n",
      "be simple, and are easily practised upon by the dishonest, because they\n",
      "have no examples of what evil is in their own souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, I said, the judge should not be young; he should have learned\n",
      "to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long observation\n",
      "of the nature of evil in others: knowledge should be his guide, not\n",
      "personal experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to your\n",
      "question); for he is good who has a good soul. But the cunning and\n",
      "suspicious nature of which we spoke,--he who has committed many crimes,\n",
      "and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst\n",
      "his fellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because he\n",
      "judges of them by himself: but when he gets into the company of men of\n",
      "virtue, who have the experience of age, he appears to be a fool again,\n",
      "owing to his unseasonable suspicions; he cannot recognise an honest man,\n",
      "because he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at the same time, as\n",
      "the bad are more numerous than the good, and he meets with them oftener,\n",
      "he thinks himself, and is by others thought to be, rather wise than\n",
      "foolish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but\n",
      "the other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature,\n",
      "educated by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the\n",
      "virtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom--in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in mine also.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which you\n",
      "will sanction in your state. They will minister to better natures,\n",
      "giving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in\n",
      "their bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls\n",
      "they will put an end to themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music\n",
      "which, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to practise\n",
      "the simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine unless in\n",
      "some extreme case.\n",
      "\n",
      "That I quite believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to\n",
      "stimulate the spirited element of his nature, and not to increase his\n",
      "strength; he will not, like common athletes, use exercise and regimen to\n",
      "develope his muscles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very right, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed, as is\n",
      "often supposed, the one for the training of the soul, the other for the\n",
      "training of the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "What then is the real object of them?\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe, I said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the\n",
      "improvement of the soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can that be? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of\n",
      "exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive\n",
      "devotion to music?\n",
      "\n",
      "In what way shown? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of\n",
      "softness and effeminacy, I replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, I am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of\n",
      "a savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what\n",
      "is good for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet surely, I said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if\n",
      "rightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, is\n",
      "liable to become hard and brutal.\n",
      "\n",
      "That I quite think.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness.\n",
      "And this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but, if\n",
      "educated rightly, will be gentle and moderate.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuredly.\n",

      "And both should be in harmony?\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond question.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul\n",
      "through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs\n",
      "of which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in\n",
      "warbling and the delights of song; in the first stage of the process\n",
      "the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made\n",
      "useful, instead of brittle and useless. But, if he carries on the\n",
      "softening and soothing process, in the next stage he begins to melt and\n",
      "waste, until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his\n",
      "soul; and he becomes a feeble warrior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily\n",
      "accomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of music\n",
      "weakening the spirit renders him excitable;--on the least provocation\n",
      "he flames up at once, and is speedily extinguished; instead of having\n",
      "spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a great\n",
      "feeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy, at\n",
      "first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit,\n",
      "and he becomes twice the man that he was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no converse with the\n",

      "no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture,\n",

      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",

      "the weapon of persuasion,--he is like a wild beast, all violence and\n",
      "fierceness, and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in all\n",
      "ignorance and evil conditions, and has no sense of propriety and grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is quite true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as there are two principles of human nature, one the spirited\n",
      "and the other the philosophical, some God, as I should say, has given\n",

      "harmonized.\n",
      "\n",
      "That appears to be the intention.\n",

      "That is also clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to\n",
      "husbandry?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must they not\n",
      "be those who have most the character of guardians?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a\n",
      "special care of the State?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the\n",
      "same interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune\n",
      "is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there must be a selection. Let us note among the guardians those\n",
      "who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for\n",
      "the good of their country, and the greatest repugnance to do what is\n",
      "against her interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are the right men.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they will have to be watched at every age, in order that we may see\n",
      "whether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence\n",
      "either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty\n",
      "to the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "How cast off? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will explain to you, I replied. A resolution may go out of a man's\n",
      "mind either with his will or against his will; with his will when he\n",
      "gets rid of a falsehood and learns better, against his will whenever he\n",
      "is deprived of a truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand, he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the meaning of\n",
      "the unwilling I have yet to learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good,\n",
      "and willingly of evil? Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to\n",
      "possess the truth a good? and you would agree that to conceive things as\n",
      "they are is to possess the truth?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he replied; I agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived\n",
      "of truth against their will.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or\n",
      "force, or enchantment?\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, he replied, I do not understand you.\n",
      "\n",
      "I fear that I must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians. I only\n",
      "mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget;\n",
      "argument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of the other; and\n",
      "this I call theft. Now you understand me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those again who are forced, are those whom the violence of some pain or\n",
      "grief compels to change their opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand, he said, and you are quite right.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change\n",
      "their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the\n",
      "sterner influence of fear?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, as I was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best\n",
      "guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest\n",
      "of the State is to be the rule of their lives. We must watch them from\n",
      "their youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are\n",
      "most likely to forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers and is\n",
      "not deceived is to be selected, and he who fails in the trial is to be\n",
      "rejected. That will be the way?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for\n",
      "them, in which they will be made to give further proof of the same\n",
      "qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very right, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, I said, we must try them with enchantments--that is the third\n",
      "sort of test--and see what will be their behaviour: like those who take\n",
      "colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature, so\n",
      "must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass them\n",
      "into pleasures, and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in\n",
      "the furnace, that we may discover whether they are armed against\n",
      "all enchantments, and of a noble bearing always, good guardians of\n",
      "themselves and of the music which they have learned, and retaining under\n",
      "all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature, such as will be\n",
      "most serviceable to the individual and to the State. And he who at every\n",
      "age, as boy and youth and in mature life, has come out of the trial\n",
      "victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the\n",
      "State; he shall be honoured in life and death, and shall receive\n",
      "sepulture and other memorials of honour, the greatest that we have to\n",
      "give. But him who fails, we must reject. I am inclined to think that\n",
      "this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be\n",
      "chosen and appointed. I speak generally, and not with any pretension to\n",
      "exactness.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, speaking generally, I agree with you, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And perhaps the word 'guardian' in the fullest sense ought to be applied\n",
      "to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and\n",
      "maintain peace among our citizens at home, that the one may not have the\n",
      "will, or the others the power, to harm us. The young men whom we\n",
      "before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and\n",
      "supporters of the principles of the rulers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with you, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "How then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we\n",
      "lately spoke--just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers, if that\n",
      "be possible, and at any rate the rest of the city?\n",
      "\n",
      "What sort of lie? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing new, I replied; only an old Phoenician tale (Laws) of what has\n",
      "often occurred before now in other places, (as the poets say, and have\n",
      "made the world believe,) though not in our time, and I do not know\n",
      "whether such an event could ever happen again, or could now even be made\n",
      "probable, if it did.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Speak, he said, and fear not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well then, I will speak, although I really know not how to look you\n",
      "in the face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which\n",
      "I propose to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the\n",
      "soldiers, and lastly to the people. They are to be told that their youth\n",
      "was a dream, and the education and training which they received from\n",
      "us, an appearance only; in reality during all that time they were being\n",
      "formed and fed in the womb of the earth, where they themselves and their\n",
      "arms and appurtenances were manufactured; when they were completed, the\n",
      "earth, their mother, sent them up; and so, their country being their\n",
      "mother and also their nurse, they are bound to advise for her good, and\n",
      "to defend her against attacks, and her citizens they are to regard as\n",
      "children of the earth and their own brothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "You had good reason, he said, to be ashamed of the lie which you were\n",
      "going to tell.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, I replied, but there is more coming; I have only told you half.\n",
      "Citizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers, yet God\n",
      "has framed you differently. Some of you have the power of command, and\n",
      "in the composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also\n",
      "they have the greatest honour; others he has made of silver, to be\n",
      "auxiliaries; others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has\n",
      "composed of brass and iron; and the species will generally be preserved\n",
      "in the children. But as all are of the same original stock, a golden\n",
      "parent will sometimes have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden\n",
      "son. And God proclaims as a first principle to the rulers, and above all\n",
      "else, that there is nothing which they should so anxiously guard, or of\n",
      "which they are to be such good guardians, as of the purity of the race.\n",
      "They should observe what elements mingle in their offspring; for if the\n",
      "son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron,\n",
      "then nature orders a transposition of ranks, and the eye of the ruler\n",
      "must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the\n",
      "scale and become a husbandman or artisan, just as there may be sons of\n",
      "artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised\n",
      "to honour, and become guardians or auxiliaries. For an oracle says that\n",
      "when a man of brass or iron guards the State, it will be destroyed. Such\n",
      "is the tale; is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in\n",
      "it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of\n",
      "accomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale,\n",
      "and their sons' sons, and posterity after them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see the difficulty, I replied; yet the fostering of such a belief will\n",
      "make them care more for the city and for one another. Enough, however,\n",
      "of the fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour, while\n",
      "we arm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under the command of\n",
      "their rulers. Let them look round and select a spot whence they can best\n",
      "suppress insurrection, if any prove refractory within, and also defend\n",
      "themselves against enemies, who like wolves may come down on the fold\n",
      "from without; there let them encamp, and when they have encamped, let\n",
      "them sacrifice to the proper Gods and prepare their dwellings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of\n",
      "winter and the heat of summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose that you mean houses, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; but they must be the houses of soldiers, and not of\n",
      "shop-keepers.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the difference? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "That I will endeavour to explain, I replied. To keep watch-dogs, who,\n",
      "from want of discipline or hunger, or some evil habit or other, would\n",
      "turn upon the sheep and worry them, and behave not like dogs but wolves,\n",
      "would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd?\n",
      "\n",
      "Truly monstrous, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being\n",
      "stronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and\n",
      "become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, great care should be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "And would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?\n",
      "\n",
      "But they are well-educated already, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot be so confident, my dear Glaucon, I said; I am much more\n",
      "certain that they ought to be, and that true education, whatever that\n",
      "may be, will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them\n",
      "in their relations to one another, and to those who are under their\n",
      "protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And not only their education, but their habitations, and all that\n",
      "belongs to them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue as\n",
      "guardians, nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens. Any man of\n",
      "sense must acknowledge that.\n",
      "\n",
      "He must.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then now let us consider what will be their way of life, if they are to\n",
      "realize our idea of them. In the first place, none of them should have\n",
      "any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary; neither\n",
      "should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has\n",
      "a mind to enter; their provisions should be only such as are required\n",
      "by trained warriors, who are men of temperance and courage; they should\n",
      "agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay, enough to meet\n",
      "the expenses of the year and no more; and they will go to mess and live\n",
      "together like soldiers in a camp. Gold and silver we will tell them\n",
      "that they have from God; the diviner metal is within them, and they have\n",
      "therefore no need of the dross which is current among men, and ought not\n",
      "to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture; for that commoner\n",
      "metal has been the source of many unholy deeds, but their own is\n",
      "undefiled. And they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle\n",
      "silver or gold, or be under the same roof with them, or wear them, or\n",
      "drink from them. And this will be their salvation, and they will be the\n",
      "saviours of the State. But should they ever acquire homes or lands\n",
      "or moneys of their own, they will become housekeepers and husbandmen\n",
      "instead of guardians, enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other\n",
      "citizens; hating and being hated, plotting and being plotted against,\n",
      "they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than\n",
      "of external enemies, and the hour of ruin, both to themselves and to the\n",
      "rest of the State, will be at hand. For all which reasons may we not\n",
      "say that thus shall our State be ordered, and that these shall be the\n",
      "regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and\n",
      "all other matters?\n",

      "Here Adeimantus interposed a question: How would you answer, Socrates,\n",
      "said he, if a person were to say that you are making these people\n",
      "miserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the\n",
      "city in fact belongs to them, but they are none the better for it;\n",
      "whereas other men acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses,\n",
      "and have everything handsome about them, offering sacrifices to the gods\n",
      "on their own account, and practising hospitality; moreover, as you were\n",
      "saying just now, they have gold and silver, and all that is usual among\n",
      "the favourites of fortune; but our poor citizens are no better than\n",
      "mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid in\n",
      "addition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if\n",
      "they would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on\n",
      "a mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is\n",
      "thought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature\n",
      "might be added.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we proceed along the old path, my belief, I said, is that we shall\n",
      "find the answer. And our answer will be that, even as they are, our\n",
      "guardians may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in\n",
      "founding the State was not the disproportionate happiness of any one\n",
      "class, but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a\n",
      "State which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should\n",
      "be most likely to find justice, and in the ill-ordered State injustice:\n",
      "and, having found them, we might then decide which of the two is the\n",
      "happier. At present, I take it, we are fashioning the happy State,\n",
      "not piecemeal, or with a view of making a few happy citizens, but as a\n",
      "whole; and by-and-by we will proceed to view the opposite kind of State.\n",
      "Suppose that we were painting a statue, and some one came up to us\n",
      "and said, Why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most\n",
      "beautiful parts of the body--the eyes ought to be purple, but you have\n",
      "made them black--to him we might fairly answer, Sir, you would not\n",
      "surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no\n",
      "longer eyes; consider rather whether, by giving this and the other\n",
      "features their due proportion, we make the whole beautiful. And so I say\n",
      "to you, do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of happiness\n",
      "which will make them anything but guardians; for we too can clothe our\n",
      "husbandmen in royal apparel, and set crowns of gold on their heads, and\n",
      "bid them till the ground as much as they like, and no more. Our potters\n",
      "also might be allowed to repose on couches, and feast by the fireside,\n",
      "passing round the winecup, while their wheel is conveniently at hand,\n",
      "and working at pottery only as much as they like; in this way we might\n",
      "make every class happy--and then, as you imagine, the whole State would\n",
      "be happy. But do not put this idea into our heads; for, if we listen\n",
      "to you, the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman, the potter will\n",
      "cease to be a potter, and no one will have the character of any distinct\n",
      "class in the State. Now this is not of much consequence where the\n",
      "corruption of society, and pretension to be what you are not, is\n",
      "confined to cobblers; but when the guardians of the laws and of the\n",
      "government are only seeming and not real guardians, then see how they\n",
      "turn the State upside down; and on the other hand they alone have the\n",
      "power of giving order and happiness to the State. We mean our guardians\n",
      "to be true saviours and not the destroyers of the State, whereas our\n",
      "opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival, who are enjoying a life\n",
      "of revelry, not of citizens who are doing their duty to the State. But,\n",
      "if so, we mean different things, and he is speaking of something which\n",
      "is not a State. And therefore we must consider whether in appointing\n",
      "our guardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually, or\n",
      "whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the State\n",
      "as a whole. But if the latter be the truth, then the guardians and\n",
      "auxiliaries, and all others equally with them, must be compelled or\n",
      "induced to do their own work in the best way. And thus the whole State\n",
      "will grow up in a noble order, and the several classes will receive the\n",
      "proportion of happiness which nature assigns to them.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes; he greatly deteriorates.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide himself\n",
      "with tools or instruments, he will not work equally well himself, nor\n",
      "will he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well.\n",

      "Then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and\n",
      "their work are equally liable to degenerate?\n",
      "\n",
      "That is evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, then, is a discovery of new evils, I said, against which\n",

      "unobserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "What evils?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wealth, I said, and poverty; the one is the parent of luxury and\n",

      "How so? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, I said, if we have to fight, our side will be\n",
      "trained warriors fighting against an army of rich men.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you not suppose, Adeimantus, that a single boxer who was\n",
      "perfect in his art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do\n",
      "gentlemen who were not boxers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly, if they came upon him at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, now, I said, if he were able to run away and then turn and strike\n",
      "at the one who first came up? And supposing he were to do this several\n",
      "times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert,\n",
      "overturn more than one stout personage?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and\n",
      "practise of boxing than they have in military qualities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likely enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or\n",
      "three times their own number?\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with you, for I think you right.\n",
      "\n",
      "And suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to one\n",
      "of the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and gold we\n",
      "neither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore\n",
      "come and help us in war, and take the spoils of the other city: Who,\n",
      "on hearing these words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs,\n",
      "rather than, with the dogs on their side, against fat and tender sheep?\n",
      "\n",
      "That is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the poor State if\n",
      "the wealth of many States were to be gathered into one.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how simple of you to use the term State at all of any but our own!\n",
      "\n",
      "Why so?\n",
      "\n",
      "You ought to speak of other States in the plural number; not one of\n",
      "them is a city, but many cities, as they say in the game. For indeed any\n",
      "city, however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of the\n",
      "poor, the other of the rich; these are at war with one another; and in\n",
      "either there are many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether\n",
      "beside the mark if you treated them all as a single State. But if you\n",
      "deal with them as many, and give the wealth or power or persons of the\n",
      "one to the others, you will always have a great many friends and not\n",
      "many enemies. And your State, while the wise order which has now been\n",
      "prescribed continues to prevail in her, will be the greatest of States,\n",
      "I do not mean to say in reputation or appearance, but in deed and truth,\n",
      "though she number not more than a thousand defenders. A single State\n",
      "which is her equal you will hardly find, either among Hellenes or\n",
      "barbarians, though many that appear to be as great and many times\n",
      "greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is most true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what, I said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they\n",
      "are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory which\n",
      "they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?\n",
      "\n",
      "What limit would you propose?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would allow the State to increase so far as is consistent with unity;\n",
      "that, I think, is the proper limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here then, I said, is another order which will have to be conveyed to\n",
      "our guardians: Let our city be accounted neither large nor small, but\n",
      "one and self-sufficing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we impose\n",
      "upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the other, said I, of which we were speaking before is lighter\n",
      "still,--I mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when\n",
      "inferior, and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of\n",
      "the lower classes, when naturally superior. The intention was, that, in\n",
      "the case of the citizens generally, each individual should be put to the\n",
      "use for which nature intended him, one to one work, and then every man\n",
      "would do his own business, and be one and not many; and so the whole\n",
      "city would be one and not many.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; that is not so difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "The regulations which we are prescribing, my good Adeimantus, are not,\n",
      "as might be supposed, a number of great principles, but trifles all,\n",
      "if care be taken, as the saying is, of the one great thing,--a thing,\n",
      "however, which I would rather call, not great, but sufficient for our\n",
      "purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "What may that be? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Education, I said, and nurture: If our citizens are well educated,\n",
      "and grow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through all\n",
      "these, as well as other matters which I omit; such, for example, as\n",
      "marriage, the possession of women and the procreation of children, which\n",
      "will all follow the general principle that friends have all things in\n",
      "common, as the proverb says.\n",
      "\n",
      "That will be the best way of settling them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I said, the State, if once started well, moves with accumulating\n",
      "force like a wheel. For good nurture and education implant good\n",
      "constitutions, and these good constitutions taking root in a good\n",
      "education improve more and more, and this improvement affects the breed\n",
      "in man as in other animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very possibly, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then to sum up: This is the point to which, above all, the attention of\n",
      "our rulers should be directed,--that music and gymnastic be preserved in\n",
      "their original form, and no innovation made. They must do their utmost\n",
      "to maintain them intact. And when any one says that mankind most regard\n",
      "\n",
      "'The newest song which the singers have,'\n",
      "\n",
      "they will be afraid that he may be praising, not new songs, but a new\n",
      "kind of song; and this ought not to be praised, or conceived to be the\n",
      "meaning of the poet; for any musical innovation is full of danger to the\n",
      "whole State, and ought to be prohibited. So Damon tells me, and I\n",
      "can quite believe him;--he says that when modes of music change, the\n",
      "fundamental laws of the State always change with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, said Adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to Damon's and your\n",
      "own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress\n",
      "in music?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it appears\n",
      "harmless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by\n",
      "little this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates\n",
      "into manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it invades\n",
      "contracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to laws and\n",
      "constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at last, Socrates, by an\n",
      "overthrow of all rights, private as well as public.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that true? I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is my belief, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as I was saying, our youth should be trained from the first in\n",
      "a stricter system, for if amusements become lawless, and the youths\n",
      "themselves become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted\n",
      "and virtuous citizens.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they have made a good beginning in play, and by the help of\n",
      "music have gained the habit of good order, then this habit of order, in\n",
      "a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany them\n",
      "in all their actions and be a principle of growth to them, and if there\n",
      "be any fallen places in the State will raise them up again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus educated, they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which\n",
      "their predecessors have altogether neglected.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean such things as these:--when the young are to be silent before\n",
      "their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and\n",
      "making them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes\n",
      "are to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners in\n",
      "general. You would agree with me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is, I think, small wisdom in legislating about such\n",
      "matters,--I doubt if it is ever done; nor are any precise written\n",
      "enactments about them likely to be lasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would seem, Adeimantus, that the direction in which education starts\n",
      "a man, will determine his future life. Does not like always attract\n",
      "like?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and\n",
      "may be the reverse of good?\n",
      "\n",
      "That is not to be denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for this reason, I said, I shall not attempt to legislate further\n",
      "about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally enough, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, and about the business of the agora, and the ordinary dealings\n",
      "between man and man, or again about agreements with artisans; about\n",
      "insult and injury, or the commencement of actions, and the appointment\n",
      "of juries, what would you say? there may also arise questions about\n",
      "any impositions and exactions of market and harbour dues which may\n",
      "be required, and in general about the regulations of markets, police,\n",
      "harbours, and the like. But, oh heavens! shall we condescend to\n",
      "legislate on any of these particulars?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about them on\n",
      "good men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough\n",
      "for themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, my friend, if God will only preserve to them the laws which\n",
      "we have given them.\n",
      "\n",
      "And without divine help, said Adeimantus, they will go on for ever\n",
      "making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining\n",
      "perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "You would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no\n",
      "self-restraint, will not leave off their habits of intemperance?\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; and what a delightful life they lead! they are always\n",
      "doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders, and always\n",
      "fancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises\n",
      "them to try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such cases are very common, he said, with invalids of this sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I replied; and the charming thing is that they deem him their worst\n",
      "enemy who tells them the truth, which is simply that, unless they give\n",
      "up eating and drinking and wenching and idling, neither drug nor cautery\n",
      "nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Charming! he replied. I see nothing charming in going into a passion\n",
      "with a man who tells you what is right.\n",
      "\n",
      "These gentlemen, I said, do not seem to be in your good graces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuredly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor would you praise the behaviour of States which act like the men whom\n",
      "I was just now describing. For are there not ill-ordered States in\n",
      "which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the\n",
      "constitution; and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under\n",
      "this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in\n",
      "anticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and\n",
      "good statesman--do not these States resemble the persons whom I was\n",
      "describing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; the States are as bad as the men; and I am very far from\n",
      "praising them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these ready\n",
      "ministers of political corruption?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, I do; but not of all of them, for there are some whom\n",
      "the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are\n",
      "really statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean? I said; you should have more feeling for them. When a\n",
      "man cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure declare\n",
      "that he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they say?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, he said, certainly not in that case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as a\n",
      "play, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as I was describing; they\n",
      "are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds\n",
      "in contracts, and the other rascalities which I was mentioning, not\n",
      "knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; that is just what they are doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I conceive, I said, that the true legislator will not trouble\n",
      "himself with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the\n",
      "constitution either in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered State; for\n",
      "in the former they are quite useless, and in the latter there will be no\n",
      "difficulty in devising them; and many of them will naturally flow out of\n",
      "our previous regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of\n",
      "legislation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing to us, I replied; but to Apollo, the God of Delphi, there\n",
      "remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of\n",
      "all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which are they? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The institution of temples and sacrifices, and the entire service of\n",
      "gods, demigods, and heroes; also the ordering of the repositories of\n",
      "the dead, and the rites which have to be observed by him who would\n",
      "propitiate the inhabitants of the world below. These are matters of\n",
      "which we are ignorant ourselves, and as founders of a city we should be\n",
      "unwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity. He\n",
      "is the god who sits in the centre, on the navel of the earth, and he is\n",
      "the interpreter of religion to all mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are right, and we will do as you propose.\n",
      "\n",
      "But where, amid all this, is justice? son of Ariston, tell me where. Now\n",
      "that our city has been made habitable, light a candle and search, and\n",
      "get your brother and Polemarchus and the rest of our friends to help,\n",
      "and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where injustice,\n",
      "and in what they differ from one another, and which of them the man who\n",
      "would be happy should have for his portion, whether seen or unseen by\n",
      "gods and men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonsense, said Glaucon: did you not promise to search yourself, saying\n",
      "that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety?\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as good as\n",
      "my word; but you must join.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, then, I hope to make the discovery in this way: I mean to begin\n",
      "with the assumption that our State, if rightly ordered, is perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is most certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "And being perfect, is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and just.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is likewise clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "And whichever of these qualities we find in the State, the one which is\n",
      "not found will be the residue?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there were four things, and we were searching for one of them,\n",
      "wherever it might be, the one sought for might be known to us from the\n",
      "first, and there would be no further trouble; or we might know the other\n",
      "three first, and then the fourth would clearly be the one left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are\n",
      "also four in number?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "First among the virtues found in the State, wisdom comes into view, and\n",
      "in this I detect a certain peculiarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "The State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good\n",
      "in counsel?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance,\n",
      "but by knowledge, do men counsel well?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of\n",
      "knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in\n",
      "carpentering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge\n",
      "which counsels for the best about wooden implements?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said,\n",
      "nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not by reason of any of them, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would\n",
      "give the city the name of agricultural?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I said, and is there any knowledge in our recently-founded State\n",
      "among any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular thing\n",
      "in the State, but about the whole, and considers how a State can best\n",
      "deal with itself and with other States?\n",
      "\n",
      "There certainly is.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what is this knowledge, and among whom is it found? I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and is found among\n",
      "those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this\n",
      "sort of knowledge?\n",
      "\n",
      "The name of good in counsel and truly wise.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more\n",
      "smiths?\n",
      "\n",
      "The smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a\n",
      "name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?\n",
      "\n",
      "Much the smallest.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge\n",
      "which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole\n",
      "State, being thus constituted according to nature, will be wise; and\n",
      "this, which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been\n",
      "ordained by nature to be of all classes the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, then, I said, the nature and place in the State of one of the four\n",
      "virtues has somehow or other been discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, I said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage,\n",
      "and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous\n",

      "behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one, he replied, would ever think of any other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly, but their\n",
      "courage or cowardice will not, as I conceive, have the effect of making\n",
      "the city either the one or the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which\n",
      "preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of\n",
      "things to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator\n",
      "educated them; and this is what you term courage.\n",

      "Salvation of what?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and of\n",
      "what nature, which the law implants through education; and I mean by the\n",
      "words 'under all circumstances' to intimate that in pleasure or in pain,\n",
      "or under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves, and does not\n",

      "\n",
      "You know, I said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making the\n",

      "prepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that the white\n",
      "ground may take the purple hue in full perfection. The dyeing then\n",
      "proceeds; and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour,\n",
      "and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom.\n",
      "But, when the ground has not been duly prepared, you will have noticed\n",
      "how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; I know that they have a washed-out and ridiculous\n",
      "appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then now, I said, you will understand what our object was in selecting\n",
      "our soldiers, and educating them in music and gymnastic; we were\n",

      "laws in perfection, and the colour of their opinion about dangers and\n",
      "of every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture\n",
      "and training, not to be washed away by such potent lyes as\n",
      "pleasure--mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye;\n",
      "or by sorrow, fear, and desire, the mightiest of all other solvents. And\n",
      "this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity with\n",
      "law about real and false dangers I call and maintain to be courage,\n",
      "unless you disagree.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I agree, he replied; for I suppose that you mean to exclude mere\n",
      "uninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or of a slave--this,\n",
      "in your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to\n",
      "have another name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I may infer courage to be such as you describe?\n",
      "\n",

      "you will not be far wrong;--hereafter, if you like, we will carry the\n",

      "justice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are right, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two virtues remain to be discovered in the State--first, temperance, and\n",
      "then justice which is the end of our search.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance?\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire\n",
      "that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of;\n",
      "and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering\n",
      "temperance first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, I replied, I should not be justified in refusing your\n",
      "request.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then consider, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I replied; I will; and as far as I can at present see, the virtue\n",
      "of temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the\n",
      "preceding.\n",
      "\n",
      "How so? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Temperance, I replied, is the ordering or controlling of certain\n",
      "pleasures and desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying of\n",
      "'a man being his own master;' and other traces of the same notion may be\n",
      "found in language.\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of himself;' for\n",
      "the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and in all\n",
      "these modes of speaking the same person is denoted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meaning is, I believe, that in the human soul there is a better and\n",
      "also a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under control,\n",
      "then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term of\n",
      "praise: but when, owing to evil education or association, the better\n",
      "principle, which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the greater mass\n",
      "of the worse--in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self\n",
      "and unprincipled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there is reason in that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, I said, look at our newly-created State, and there you will\n",
      "find one of these two conditions realized; for the State, as you\n",
      "will acknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words\n",
      "'temperance' and 'self-mastery' truly express the rule of the better\n",
      "part over the worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, I see that what you say is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires\n",
      "and pains are generally found in children and women and servants, and in\n",
      "the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are\n",
      "under the guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only in a\n",
      "few, and those the best born and best educated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two, as you may perceive, have a place in our State; and the\n",
      "meaner desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and\n",
      "wisdom of the few.\n",
      "\n",
      "That I perceive, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own\n",
      "pleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a\n",
      "designation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if there be any State in which rulers and subjects will be agreed as\n",
      "to the question who are to rule, that again will be our State?\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class will\n",
      "temperance be found--in the rulers or in the subjects?\n",
      "\n",
      "In both, as I should imagine, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance\n",
      "was a sort of harmony?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which\n",
      "resides in a part only, the one making the State wise and the other\n",
      "valiant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs through\n",
      "all the notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the weaker and the\n",
      "stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them to be stronger\n",
      "or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or anything else.\n",
      "Most truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of the\n",
      "naturally superior and inferior, as to the right to rule of either, both\n",
      "in states and individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "I entirely agree with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, I said, we may consider three out of the four virtues to have\n",
      "been discovered in our State. The last of those qualities which make a\n",
      "state virtuous must be justice, if we only knew what that was.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inference is obvious.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time then has arrived, Glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should\n",
      "surround the cover, and look sharp that justice does not steal away, and\n",
      "pass out of sight and escape us; for beyond a doubt she is somewhere in\n",
      "this country: watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her, and if\n",
      "you see her first, let me know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would that I could! but you should regard me rather as a follower who\n",
      "has just eyes enough to see what you show him--that is about as much as\n",
      "I am good for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Offer up a prayer with me and follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will, but you must show me the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is no path, I said, and the wood is dark and perplexing; still we\n",
      "must push on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us push on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here I saw something: Halloo! I said, I begin to perceive a track, and I\n",
      "believe that the quarry will not escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good news, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Truly, I said, we are stupid fellows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, my good sir, at the beginning of our enquiry, ages ago, there was\n",
      "justice tumbling out at our feet, and we never saw her; nothing could be\n",
      "more ridiculous. Like people who go about looking for what they have\n",
      "in their hands--that was the way with us--we looked not at what we\n",
      "were seeking, but at what was far off in the distance; and therefore, I\n",
      "suppose, we missed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking\n",
      "of justice, and have failed to recognise her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I grow impatient at the length of your exordium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well then, tell me, I said, whether I am right or not: You remember the\n",
      "original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation\n",
      "of the State, that one man should practise one thing only, the thing to\n",
      "which his nature was best adapted;--now justice is this principle or a\n",
      "part of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we often said that one man should do one thing only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, we affirmed that justice was doing one's own business, and not\n",
      "being a busybody; we said so again and again, and many others have said\n",
      "the same to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we said so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then to do one's own business in a certain way may be assumed to be\n",
      "justice. Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot, but I should like to be told.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I think that this is the only virtue which remains in the\n",
      "State when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are\n",
      "abstracted; and, that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the\n",
      "existence of all of them, and while remaining in them is also their\n",
      "preservative; and we were saying that if the three were discovered by\n",
      "us, justice would be the fourth or remaining one.\n",
      "\n",
      "That follows of necessity.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its\n",
      "presence contributes most to the excellence of the State, whether the\n",
      "agreement of rulers and subjects, or the preservation in the soldiers of\n",
      "the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers, or\n",
      "wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers, or whether this other which I am\n",
      "mentioning, and which is found in children and women, slave and freeman,\n",
      "artisan, ruler, subject,--the quality, I mean, of every one doing his\n",
      "own work, and not being a busybody, would claim the palm--the question\n",
      "is not so easily answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying which.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the power of each individual in the State to do his own work\n",
      "appears to compete with the other political virtues, wisdom, temperance,\n",
      "courage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the virtue which enters into this competition is justice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us look at the question from another point of view: Are not\n",
      "the rulers in a State those to whom you would entrust the office of\n",
      "determining suits at law?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither\n",
      "take what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; that is their principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is a just principle?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and\n",
      "doing what is a man's own, and belongs to him?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. Suppose a\n",
      "carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a\n",
      "carpenter; and suppose them to exchange their implements or their\n",
      "duties, or the same person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be\n",
      "the change; do you think that any great harm would result to the State?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not much.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a\n",
      "trader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number\n",
      "of his followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way\n",
      "into the class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and\n",
      "guardians, for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements\n",
      "or the duties of the other; or when one man is trader, legislator, and\n",
      "warrior all in one, then I think you will agree with me in saying that\n",
      "this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of\n",
      "the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling\n",
      "of one with another, or the change of one into another, is the greatest\n",
      "harm to the State, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Precisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the greatest degree of evil-doing to one's own city would be termed\n",
      "by you injustice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "This then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the\n",
      "auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice,\n",
      "and will make the city just.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will not, I said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on trial, this\n",
      "conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in\n",
      "the State, there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not\n",
      "verified, we must have a fresh enquiry. First let us complete the old\n",
      "investigation, which we began, as you remember, under the impression\n",
      "that, if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale, there\n",
      "would be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual. That\n",
      "larger example appeared to be the State, and accordingly we constructed\n",
      "as good a one as we could, knowing well that in the good State justice\n",
      "would be found. Let the discovery which we made be now applied to the\n",
      "individual--if they agree, we shall be satisfied; or, if there be a\n",
      "difference in the individual, we will come back to the State and\n",
      "have another trial of the theory. The friction of the two when rubbed\n",
      "together may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth,\n",
      "and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls.\n",
      "\n",
      "That will be in regular course; let us do as you say.\n",
      "\n",
      "I proceeded to ask: When two things, a greater and less, are called by\n",
      "the same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the\n",
      "same?\n",
      "\n",
      "Like, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be like\n",
      "the just State?\n",
      "\n",
      "He will.\n",
      "\n",
      "And a State was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the\n",
      "State severally did their own business; and also thought to be temperate\n",
      "and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities\n",
      "of these same classes?\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three\n",
      "principles in his own soul which are found in the State; and he may be\n",
      "rightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same\n",
      "manner?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more then, O my friend, we have alighted upon an easy\n",
      "question--whether the soul has these three principles or not?\n",
      "\n",
      "An easy question! Nay, rather, Socrates, the proverb holds that hard is\n",
      "the good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, I said; and I do not think that the method which we are\n",
      "employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question;\n",
      "the true method is another and a longer one. Still we may arrive at a\n",
      "solution not below the level of the previous enquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "May we not be satisfied with that? he said;--under the circumstances, I\n",
      "am quite content.\n",
      "\n",
      "I too, I replied, shall be extremely well satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Must we not acknowledge, I said, that in each of us there are the same\n",
      "principles and habits which there are in the State; and that from the\n",
      "individual they pass into the State?--how else can they come there? Take\n",
      "the quality of passion or spirit;--it would be ridiculous to imagine\n",
      "that this quality, when found in States, is not derived from the\n",
      "individuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the Thracians,\n",
      "Scythians, and in general the northern nations; and the same may be said\n",
      "of the love of knowledge, which is the special characteristic of our\n",
      "part of the world, or of the love of money, which may, with equal truth,\n",
      "be attributed to the Phoenicians and Egyptians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly so, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no difficulty in understanding this.\n",
      "\n",
      "None whatever.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether\n",
      "these principles are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn\n",
      "with one part of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third\n",
      "part desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites; or whether the\n",
      "whole soul comes into play in each sort of action--to determine that is\n",
      "the difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; there lies the difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or\n",
      "different.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can we? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I replied as follows: The same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon\n",
      "in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time,\n",

      "standing and also moving his hands and his head, and suppose a person\n",
      "to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same\n",

      "the same time (and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the\n",
      "same spot), his objection would not be admitted by us, because in\n",
      "such cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of\n",
      "themselves; we should rather say that they have both an axis and a\n",
      "circumference, and that the axis stands still, for there is no deviation\n",
      "from the perpendicular; and that the circumference goes round. But if,\n",
      "while revolving, the axis inclines either to the right or left, forwards\n",
      "or backwards, then in no point of view can they be at rest.\n",
      "\n",

      "again willing and wishing,--all these you would refer to the classes\n",
      "already mentioned. You would say--would you not?--that the soul of him\n",

      "The object of one is food, and of the other drink?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",

      "example, warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word, drink of any\n",
      "particular sort: but if the thirst be accompanied by heat, then the\n",
      "desire is of cold drink; or, if accompanied by cold, then of warm drink;\n",
      "or, if the thirst be excessive, then the drink which is desired will be\n",
      "excessive; or, if not great, the quantity of drink will also be small:\n",

      "the natural satisfaction of thirst, as food is of hunger?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of the\n",
      "simple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified object.\n",
      "\n",
      "But here a confusion may arise; and I should wish to guard against an\n",
      "opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only, but good\n",
      "drink, or food only, but good food; for good is the universal object of\n",
      "desire, and thirst being a desire, will necessarily be thirst after good\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, he replied, the opponent might have something to say.\n",

      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And does not the same principle hold in the sciences? The object of\n",

      "is qualified, the other is also qualified. I do not mean to say that\n",
      "relatives may not be disparate, or that the science of health is\n",
      "healthy, or of disease necessarily diseased, or that the sciences of\n",
      "good and evil are therefore good and evil; but only that, when the term\n",
      "science is no longer used absolutely, but has a qualified object which\n",
      "in this case is the nature of health and disease, it becomes defined,\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, thirst is relative to drink.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "And if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink,\n",

      "coming up one day from the Piraeus, under the north wall on the outside,\n",
      "observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution.\n",
      "He felt a desire to see them, and also a dread and abhorrence of them;\n",
      "for a time he struggled and covered his eyes, but at length the desire\n",
      "got the better of him; and forcing them open, he ran up to the dead\n",
      "bodies, saying, Look, ye wretches, take your fill of the fair sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have heard the story myself, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire,\n",
      "as though they were two distinct things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; that is the meaning, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a man's\n",
      "desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself, and is\n",
      "angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle, which is\n",
      "like the struggle of factions in a State, his spirit is on the side of\n",
      "his reason;--but for the passionate or spirited element to take part\n",
      "with the desires when reason decides that she should not be opposed,\n",
      "is a sort of thing which I believe that you never observed occurring in\n",
      "yourself, nor, as I should imagine, in any one else?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another, the nobler\n",
      "he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering, such as\n",
      "hunger, or cold, or any other pain which the injured person may inflict\n",
      "upon him--these he deems to be just, and, as I say, his anger refuses to\n",
      "be excited by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, then he boils\n",
      "and chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice; and\n",
      "because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more\n",
      "determined to persevere and conquer. His noble spirit will not be\n",
      "quelled until he either slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice\n",
      "of the shepherd, that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I perceive, I said, that you quite understand me; there is, however, a\n",
      "further point which I wish you to consider.\n",
      "\n",
      "What point?\n",
      "\n",
      "You remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind\n",
      "of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the conflict\n",
      "of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most assuredly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a further question arises: Is passion different from reason also, or\n",
      "only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three principles\n",
      "in the soul, there will only be two, the rational and the concupiscent;\n",
      "or rather, as the State was composed of three classes, traders,\n",
      "auxiliaries, counsellors, so may there not be in the individual soul a\n",
      "third element which is passion or spirit, and when not corrupted by bad\n",
      "education is the natural auxiliary of reason?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, there must be a third.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be different\n",
      "from desire, turn out also to be different from reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that is easily proved:--We may observe even in young children that\n",
      "they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some\n",
      "of them never seem to attain to the use of reason, and most of them late\n",
      "enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent, I said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals,\n",
      "which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. And we may\n",
      "once more appeal to the words of Homer, which have been already quoted\n",
      "by us,\n",
      "\n",
      "'He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul,'\n",
      "\n",
      "for in this verse Homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons\n",
      "about the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger\n",
      "which is rebuked by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed\n",
      "that the same principles which exist in the State exist also in the\n",
      "individual, and that they are three in number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Assuredly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way\n",
      "in which the State is just?\n",
      "\n",
      "That follows, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "We cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in each\n",
      "of the three classes doing the work of its own class?\n",
      "\n",
      "We are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of\n",
      "his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, we must remember that too.\n",
      "\n",
      "And ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of\n",

      "wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly to\n",
      "know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in each\n",

      "Assuredly.\n",

      "ought to rule, and do not rebel?\n",

      "of what quality a man will be just.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is very certain.\n",
      "\n",

      "Yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law; at\n",
      "the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be\n",
      "serious. Not long ago, as we shall remind them, the Hellenes were of the\n",
      "opinion, which is still generally received among the barbarians, that\n",

      "No doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far\n",
      "better than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the outward\n",
      "eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted, then the\n",
      "man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule\n",

      "not at all? And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or\n",

      "yourselves, at the first foundation of the State, admitted the principle\n",
      "that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature.' And\n",
      "certainly, if I am not mistaken, such an admission was made by us. 'And\n",
      "do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed?' And we\n",
      "shall reply: Of course they do. Then we shall be asked, 'Whether the\n",
      "tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different, and such as\n",
      "are agreeable to their different natures?' Certainly they should. 'But\n",
      "if so, have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that\n",
      "men and women, whose natures are so entirely different, ought to perform\n",
      "the same actions?'--What defence will you make for us, my good Sir,\n",
      "against any one who offers these objections?\n",
      "\n",
      "That is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and I shall\n",
      "and I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the objections, Glaucon, and there are many others of a like\n",
      "kind, which I foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant to\n",
      "take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and\n",
      "children.\n",
      "\n",
      "By Zeus, he said, the problem to be solved is anything but easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why yes, I said, but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth,\n",
      "whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid ocean, he\n",
      "has to swim all the same.\n",

      "pursuits, and that men's and women's natures are different. And now\n",
      "what are we saying?--that different natures ought to have the same\n",
      "pursuits,--this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Precisely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verily, Glaucon, I said, glorious is the power of the art of\n",
      "contradiction!\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do you say so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because I think that many a man falls into the practice against his\n",
      "will. When he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just\n",
      "because he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is\n",
      "speaking; and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of\n",
      "contention and not of fair discussion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do\n",
      "with us and our argument?\n",
      "\n",
      "A great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting\n",
      "unintentionally into a verbal opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In what way?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that\n",
      "different natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never\n",
      "considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of\n",
      "nature, or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits\n",
      "to different natures and the same to the same natures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, no, he said, that was never considered by us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I said: Suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question\n",
      "whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy\n",
      "men; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald men are cobblers, we\n",
      "should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers, and conversely?\n",
      "\n",
      "That would be a jest, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, a jest; and why? because we never meant when we constructed\n",
      "the State, that the opposition of natures should extend to every\n",
      "difference, but only to those differences which affected the pursuit\n",
      "in which the individual is engaged; we should have argued, for example,\n",
      "that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have\n",
      "the same nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if, I said, the male and female sex appear to differ in their\n",
      "fitness for any art or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or art\n",
      "ought to be assigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference\n",
      "consists only in women bearing and men begetting children, this does not\n",
      "amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the\n",
      "sort of education she should receive; and we shall therefore continue\n",
      "to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same\n",
      "pursuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the pursuits\n",

      "That will be quite fair.\n",
      "\n",

      "good servant to his mind, while the body of the other is a hindrance to\n",

      "\n",
      "No one will deny that.\n",
      "\n",

      "pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be\n",

      "most absurd?\n",
      "\n",
      "You are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority\n",

      "which a man has by virtue of his sex, but the gifts of nature are alike\n",
      "diffused in both; all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women\n",
      "also, but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",

      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and\n",

      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",

      "\n",
      "What a ridiculous question!\n",
      "\n",
      "You have answered me, I replied: Well, and may we not further say that\n",
      "our guardians are the best of our citizens?\n",
      "\n",
      "By far the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will not their wives be the best women?\n",

      "\n",
      "There can be nothing better.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in such\n",
      "manner as we have described, will accomplish?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest\n",
      "degree beneficial to the State?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be\n",
      "their robe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of\n",
      "their country; only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be\n",
      "assigned to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other respects\n",
      "their duties are to be the same. And as for the man who laughs at naked\n",
      "women exercising their bodies from the best of motives, in his laughter\n",
      "he is plucking\n",
      "\n",
      "'A fruit of unripe wisdom,'\n",

      "Here, then, is one difficulty in our law about women, which we may say\n",
      "that we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive for\n",
      "enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their\n",
      "pursuits in common; to the utility and also to the possibility of this\n",
      "arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, but a greater is coming; you will not think much of this\n",
      "when you see the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Go on; let me see.\n",
      "\n",
      "The law, I said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has\n",
      "preceded, is to the following effect,--'that the wives of our guardians\n",
      "are to be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is\n",
      "to know his own child, nor any child his parent.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and\n",
      "the possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more\n",
      "questionable.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not think, I said, that there can be any dispute about the very\n",
      "great utility of having wives and children in common; the possibility is\n",
      "quite another matter, and will be very much disputed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that a good many doubts may be raised about both.\n",
      "\n",
      "You imply that the two questions must be combined, I replied. Now I\n",
      "meant that you should admit the utility; and in this way, as I thought,\n",
      "I should escape from one of them, and then there would remain only the\n",
      "possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please to\n",
      "give a defence of both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I said, I submit to my fate. Yet grant me a little favour: let\n",
      "me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of\n",
      "feasting themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have\n",
      "discovered any means of effecting their wishes--that is a matter which\n",
      "never troubles them--they would rather not tire themselves by thinking\n",
      "about possibilities; but assuming that what they desire is already\n",
      "granted to them, they proceed with their plan, and delight in detailing\n",
      "what they mean to do when their wish has come true--that is a way which\n",
      "they have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for\n",
      "much. Now I myself am beginning to lose heart, and I should like, with\n",
      "your permission, to pass over the question of possibility at present.\n",
      "Assuming therefore the possibility of the proposal, I shall now proceed\n",
      "to enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements, and I shall\n",
      "demonstrate that our plan, if executed, will be of the greatest benefit\n",
      "to the State and to the guardians. First of all, then, if you have no\n",
      "objection, I will endeavour with your help to consider the advantages of\n",
      "the measure; and hereafter the question of possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no objection; proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be worthy\n",
      "of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey in the\n",
      "one and the power of command in the other; the guardians must themselves\n",
      "obey the laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any\n",
      "details which are entrusted to their care.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is right, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "You, I said, who are their legislator, having selected the men, will now\n",
      "select the women and give them to them;--they must be as far as possible\n",
      "of like natures with them; and they must live in common houses and meet\n",
      "at common meals. None of them will have anything specially his or her\n",
      "own; they will be together, and will be brought up together, and\n",
      "will associate at gymnastic exercises. And so they will be drawn by\n",
      "a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each\n",
      "other--necessity is not too strong a word, I think?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said;--necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of necessity\n",
      "which lovers know, and which is far more convincing and constraining to\n",
      "the mass of mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, I said; and this, Glaucon, like all the rest, must proceed after\n",
      "an orderly fashion; in a city of the blessed, licentiousness is an\n",
      "unholy thing which the rulers will forbid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, and it ought not to be permitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the\n",
      "highest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred?\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how can marriages be made most beneficial?--that is a question which\n",
      "I put to you, because I see in your house dogs for hunting, and of the\n",
      "nobler sort of birds not a few. Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you\n",
      "ever attended to their pairing and breeding?\n",
      "\n",
      "In what particulars?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are not\n",
      "some better than others?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care to\n",
      "breed from the best only?\n",
      "\n",
      "From the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe age?\n",
      "\n",
      "I choose only those of ripe age.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would\n",
      "greatly deteriorate?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the same of horses and animals in general?\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good heavens! my dear friend, I said, what consummate skill will our\n",
      "rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species!\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any\n",
      "particular skill?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because, I said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the body\n",
      "corporate with medicines. Now you know that when patients do not require\n",
      "medicines, but have only to be put under a regimen, the inferior sort\n",
      "of practitioner is deemed to be good enough; but when medicine has to be\n",
      "given, then the doctor should be more of a man.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, I replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose of\n",
      "falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: we were\n",
      "saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be\n",
      "of advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we were very right.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the\n",
      "regulations of marriages and births.\n",
      "\n",
      "How so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the best of\n",
      "either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior\n",
      "with the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the\n",
      "offspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the flock\n",
      "is to be maintained in first-rate condition. Now these goings on must be\n",
      "a secret which the rulers only know, or there will be a further\n",
      "danger of our herd, as the guardians may be termed, breaking out into\n",
      "rebellion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring\n",
      "together the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and\n",
      "suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings is\n",
      "a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose aim\n",
      "will be to preserve the average of population? There are many other\n",
      "things which they will have to consider, such as the effects of wars and\n",
      "diseases and any similar agencies, in order as far as this is possible\n",
      "to prevent the State from becoming either too large or too small.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less\n",
      "worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together, and then\n",
      "they will accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I think that our braver and better youth, besides their other\n",
      "honours and rewards, might have greater facilities of intercourse with\n",
      "women given them; their bravery will be a reason, and such fathers ought\n",
      "to have as many sons as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices are\n",
      "to be held by women as well as by men--\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes--\n",
      "\n",
      "The proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the\n",
      "pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who\n",
      "dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of\n",
      "the better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some\n",
      "mysterious, unknown place, as they should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be\n",
      "kept pure.\n",
      "\n",
      "They will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers to the\n",
      "fold when they are full of milk, taking the greatest possible care that\n",
      "no mother recognises her own child; and other wet-nurses may be engaged\n",
      "if more are required. Care will also be taken that the process of\n",
      "suckling shall not be protracted too long; and the mothers will have no\n",
      "getting up at night or other trouble, but will hand over all this sort\n",
      "of thing to the nurses and attendants.\n",
      "\n",
      "You suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it\n",
      "when they are having children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, said I, and so they ought. Let us, however, proceed with our\n",
      "scheme. We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what is the prime of life? May it not be defined as a period of\n",
      "about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?\n",
      "\n",
      "Which years do you mean to include?\n",
      "\n",
      "A woman, I said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to\n",
      "the State, and continue to bear them until forty; a man may begin at\n",
      "five-and-twenty, when he has passed the point at which the pulse of life\n",
      "beats quickest, and continue to beget children until he be fifty-five.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said, both in men and women those years are the prime of\n",
      "physical as well as of intellectual vigour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public\n",
      "hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing;\n",
      "the child of which he is the father, if it steals into life, will have\n",
      "been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers,\n",
      "which at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will\n",
      "offer, that the new generation may be better and more useful than their\n",
      "good and useful parents, whereas his child will be the offspring of\n",
      "darkness and strange lust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed\n",
      "age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without\n",
      "the sanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up a\n",
      "bastard to the State, uncertified and unconsecrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "This applies, however, only to those who are within the specified age:\n",
      "after that we allow them to range at will, except that a man may not\n",
      "marry his daughter or his daughter's daughter, or his mother or his\n",
      "mother's mother; and women, on the other hand, are prohibited from\n",
      "marrying their sons or fathers, or son's son or father's father, and\n",
      "so on in either direction. And we grant all this, accompanying the\n",
      "permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into\n",
      "being from seeing the light; and if any force a way to the birth, the\n",
      "parents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be\n",
      "maintained, and arrange accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "That also, he said, is a reasonable proposition. But how will they know\n",
      "who are fathers and daughters, and so on?\n",
      "\n",
      "They will never know. The way will be this:--dating from the day of the\n",
      "hymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male\n",
      "children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his\n",
      "sons, and the female children his daughters, and they will call him\n",
      "father, and he will call their children his grandchildren, and they will\n",
      "call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers. All who were\n",
      "begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together will\n",
      "be called their brothers and sisters, and these, as I was saying, will\n",
      "be forbidden to inter-marry. This, however, is not to be understood as\n",
      "an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and sisters; if the\n",
      "lot favours them, and they receive the sanction of the Pythian oracle,\n",
      "the law will allow them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite right, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such is the scheme, Glaucon, according to which the guardians of our\n",
      "State are to have their wives and families in common. And now you would\n",
      "have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest\n",
      "of our polity, and also that nothing can be better--would you not?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought\n",
      "to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the\n",
      "organization of a State,--what is the greatest good, and what is the\n",
      "greatest evil, and then consider whether our previous description has\n",
      "the stamp of the good or of the evil?\n",
      "\n",
      "By all means.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality\n",
      "where unity ought to reign? or any greater good than the bond of unity?\n",
      "\n",
      "There cannot.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there is unity where there is community of pleasures and\n",
      "pains--where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions\n",
      "of joy and sorrow?\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State is\n",
      "disorganized--when you have one half of the world triumphing and the\n",
      "other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the\n",
      "citizens?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of\n",
      "the terms 'mine' and 'not mine,' 'his' and 'not his.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly so.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest number of\n",
      "persons apply the terms 'mine' and 'not mine' in the same way to the\n",
      "same thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the\n",
      "individual--as in the body, when but a finger of one of us is hurt, the\n",
      "whole frame, drawn towards the soul as a centre and forming one kingdom\n",
      "under the ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all\n",
      "together with the part affected, and we say that the man has a pain in\n",
      "his finger; and the same expression is used about any other part of the\n",
      "body, which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the\n",
      "alleviation of suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he replied; and I agree with you that in the best-ordered\n",
      "State there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you\n",
      "describe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the\n",
      "whole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or\n",
      "sorrow with him?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered State.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will now be time, I said, for us to return to our State and see\n",
      "whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these\n",
      "fundamental principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our State like every other has rulers and subjects?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of whom will call one another citizens?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other\n",
      "States?\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally they call them masters, but in democratic States they simply\n",
      "call them rulers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the people\n",
      "give the rulers?\n",
      "\n",
      "They are called saviours and helpers, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what do the rulers call the people?\n",
      "\n",
      "Their maintainers and foster-fathers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what do they call them in other States?\n",
      "\n",
      "Slaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what do the rulers call one another in other States?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fellow-rulers.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what in ours?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fellow-guardians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who would\n",
      "speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being\n",
      "his friend?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, very often.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an\n",
      "interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as\n",
      "a stranger?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded\n",
      "by them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or\n",
      "daughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Capital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they be a family in\n",
      "name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name? For\n",
      "example, in the use of the word 'father,' would the care of a father be\n",
      "implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the\n",
      "law commands; and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an\n",
      "impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good\n",
      "either at the hands of God or of man? Are these to be or not to be the\n",
      "strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the\n",
      "citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and\n",
      "the rest of their kinsfolk?\n",
      "\n",
      "These, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than for\n",
      "them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act\n",
      "in the spirit of them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often\n",
      "heard than in any other. As I was describing before, when any one is\n",
      "well or ill, the universal word will be 'with me it is well' or 'it is\n",
      "ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying\n",
      "that they will have their pleasures and pains in common?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, and so they will.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will\n",
      "alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a\n",
      "common feeling of pleasure and pain?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, far more so than in other States.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the\n",
      "State, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and\n",
      "children?\n",
      "\n",
      "That will be the chief reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was\n",
      "implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation of\n",
      "the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?\n",
      "\n",
      "That we acknowledged, and very rightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly\n",
      "the source of the greatest good to the State?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming,--that\n",
      "the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property;\n",
      "their pay was to be their food, which they were to receive from the\n",
      "other citizens, and they were to have no private expenses; for we\n",
      "intended them to preserve their true character of guardians.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the community of property and the community of families, as I am\n",
      "saying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear\n",
      "the city in pieces by differing about 'mine' and 'not mine;' each man\n",
      "dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his\n",
      "own, where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and\n",
      "pains; but all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures\n",
      "and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is near and\n",
      "dear to them, and therefore they all tend towards a common end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their\n",
      "own, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they will\n",
      "be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or\n",
      "relations are the occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course they will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among\n",
      "them. For that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall\n",
      "maintain to be honourable and right; we shall make the protection of the\n",
      "person a matter of necessity.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is good, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; and there is a further good in the law; viz. that if a man has a\n",
      "quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there, and\n",
      "not proceed to more dangerous lengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the\n",
      "younger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any\n",
      "other violence to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor will\n",
      "he slight him in any way. For there are two guardians, shame and fear,\n",
      "mighty to prevent him: shame, which makes men refrain from laying hands\n",
      "on those who are to them in the relation of parents; fear, that the\n",
      "injured one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers, sons,\n",
      "fathers.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with\n",
      "one another?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there will be no want of peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be\n",
      "no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or\n",
      "against one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "None whatever.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will\n",
      "be rid, for they are beneath notice: such, for example, as the\n",
      "flattery of the rich by the poor, and all the pains and pangs which\n",
      "men experience in bringing up a family, and in finding money to buy\n",
      "necessaries for their household, borrowing and then repudiating, getting\n",
      "how they can, and giving the money into the hands of women and slaves\n",
      "to keep--the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in this way\n",
      "are mean enough and obvious enough, and not worth speaking of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that.\n",
      "\n",
      "And from all these evils they will be delivered, and their life will be\n",
      "blessed as the life of Olympic victors and yet more blessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "How so?\n",
      "\n",
      "The Olympic victor, I said, is deemed happy in receiving a part only of\n",
      "the blessedness which is secured to our citizens, who have won a more\n",
      "glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public\n",
      "cost. For the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole\n",
      "State; and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is\n",
      "the fulness of all that life needs; they receive rewards from the\n",
      "hands of their country while living, and after death have an honourable\n",
      "burial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, and glorious rewards they are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous discussion\n",
      "some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians\n",
      "unhappy--they had nothing and might have possessed all things--to whom\n",
      "we replied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter\n",
      "consider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make\n",
      "our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the State\n",
      "with a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but\n",
      "of the whole?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out to\n",
      "be far better and nobler than that of Olympic victors--is the life of\n",
      "shoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared with\n",
      "it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time I ought here to repeat what I have said elsewhere, that\n",
      "if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that\n",
      "he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe and\n",
      "harmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best, but\n",
      "infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his\n",
      "head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself, then he will\n",
      "have to learn how wisely Hesiod spoke, when he said, 'half is more than\n",
      "the whole.'\n",
      "\n",
      "If he were to consult me, I should say to him: Stay where you are, when\n",
      "you have the offer of such a life.\n",
      "\n",
      "You agree then, I said, that men and women are to have a common way of\n",
      "life such as we have described--common education, common children; and\n",
      "they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the\n",
      "city or going out to war; they are to keep watch together, and to hunt\n",
      "together like dogs; and always and in all things, as far as they are\n",
      "able, women are to share with the men? And in so doing they will do what\n",
      "is best, and will not violate, but preserve the natural relation of the\n",
      "sexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with you, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enquiry, I said, has yet to be made, whether such a community\n",
      "be found possible--as among other animals, so also among men--and if\n",
      "possible, in what way possible?\n",
      "\n",
      "You have anticipated the question which I was about to suggest.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no difficulty, I said, in seeing how war will be carried on by\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "How?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take with\n",
      "them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the manner\n",
      "of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they will\n",
      "have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they will\n",
      "have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and\n",
      "mothers. Did you never observe in the arts how the potters' boys look on\n",
      "and help, long before they touch the wheel?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "And shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in\n",
      "giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than\n",
      "our guardians will be?\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea is ridiculous, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with other\n",
      "animals, the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive\n",
      "to valour.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is quite true, Socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which may\n",
      "often happen in war, how great the danger is! the children will be lost\n",
      "as well as their parents, and the State will never recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, I said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am far from saying that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some\n",
      "occasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their\n",
      "youth is a very important matter, for the sake of which some risk may\n",
      "fairly be incurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, very important.\n",
      "\n",
      "This then must be our first step,--to make our children spectators\n",
      "of war; but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against\n",
      "danger; then all will be well.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",

      "they can help? Should not their custom be to spare them, considering\n",

      "pretending that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now\n",
      "has been lost from this love of plunder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and also\n",
      "a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead\n",
      "body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting\n",

      "Neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of all\n",
      "the arms of Hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other\n",
      "Hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of\n",
      "spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god\n",
      "himself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, as to the devastation of Hellenic territory or the burning of\n",
      "houses, what is to be the practice?\n",
      "\n",
      "May I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?\n",
      "\n",
      "Both should be forbidden, in my judgment; I would take the annual\n",
      "produce and no more. Shall I tell you why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, you see, there is a difference in the names 'discord' and 'war,'\n",
      "and I imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the one\n",
      "is expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what is\n",
      "external and foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord, and\n",
      "only the second, war.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a very proper distinction, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race is all\n",
      "united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien and strange\n",
      "to the barbarians?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore when Hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with\n",
      "Hellenes, they will be described by us as being at war when they fight,\n",
      "and by nature enemies, and this kind of antagonism should be called war;\n",
      "but when Hellenes fight with one another we shall say that Hellas is\n",
      "then in a state of disorder and discord, they being by nature friends;\n",
      "and such enmity is to be called discord.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider then, I said, when that which we have acknowledged to be\n",
      "discord occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the lands\n",
      "and burn the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife appear!\n",
      "No true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his\n",
      "own nurse and mother: There might be reason in the conqueror depriving\n",
      "the conquered of their harvest, but still they would have the idea of\n",
      "peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that is a better temper than the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will not the city, which you are founding, be an Hellenic city?\n",
      "\n",
      "It ought to be, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then will not the citizens be good and civilized?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, very civilized.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will they not be lovers of Hellas, and think of Hellas as their own\n",
      "land, and share in the common temples?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as\n",
      "discord only--a quarrel among friends, which is not to be called a war?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "They will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy their\n",
      "opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies?\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as they are Hellenes themselves they will not devastate Hellas, nor\n",
      "will they burn houses, nor ever suppose that the whole population of a\n",
      "city--men, women, and children--are equally their enemies, for they know\n",
      "that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the\n",
      "many are their friends. And for all these reasons they will be unwilling\n",
      "to waste their lands and rase their houses; their enmity to them will\n",
      "only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty\n",
      "few to give satisfaction?\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their Hellenic\n",
      "enemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then let us enact this law also for our guardians:--that they are\n",
      "neither to devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to burn their houses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, like all our\n",
      "previous enactments, are very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "But still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in\n",
      "this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the\n",
      "commencement of this discussion you thrust aside:--Is such an order of\n",
      "things possible, and how, if at all? For I am quite ready to acknowledge\n",
      "that the plan which you propose, if only feasible, would do all sorts of\n",
      "good to the State. I will add, what you have omitted, that your citizens\n",
      "will be the bravest of warriors, and will never leave their ranks, for\n",
      "they will all know one another, and each will call the other father,\n",
      "brother, son; and if you suppose the women to join their armies, whether\n",
      "in the same rank or in the rear, either as a terror to the enemy, or as\n",
      "auxiliaries in case of need, I know that they will then be absolutely\n",
      "invincible; and there are many domestic advantages which might also be\n",
      "mentioned and which I also fully acknowledge: but, as I admit all these\n",
      "advantages and as many more as you please, if only this State of yours\n",
      "were to come into existence, we need say no more about them; assuming\n",
      "then the existence of the State, let us now turn to the question of\n",
      "possibility and ways and means--the rest may be left.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I loiter for a moment, you instantly make a raid upon me, I said, and\n",
      "have no mercy; I have hardly escaped the first and second waves, and you\n",
      "seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the third, which\n",
      "is the greatest and heaviest. When you have seen and heard the third\n",
      "wave, I think you will be more considerate and will acknowledge\n",
      "that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so\n",
      "extraordinary as that which I have now to state and investigate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the more\n",
      "determined are we that you shall tell us how such a State is possible:\n",
      "speak out and at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the search\n",

      "\n",
      "True, he replied; but what of that?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are to\n",
      "require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice; or\n",

      "a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men?\n",
      "\n",
      "The approximation will be enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the\n",
      "character of the perfectly just, and into injustice and the perfectly\n",
      "unjust, that we might have an ideal. We were to look at these in order\n",
      "that we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to\n",
      "the standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled\n",
      "them, but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with\n",
      "consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to\n",

      "He would be none the worse.\n",
      "\n",

      "To be sure.\n",

      "\n",
      "Surely not, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is the truth, I said. But if, at your request, I am to try and show\n",
      "how and under what conditions the possibility is highest, I must ask\n",
      "you, having this in view, to repeat your former admissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "What admissions?\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language?\n",
      "Does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual,\n",
      "whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of\n",
      "the truth? What do you say?\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you must not insist on my proving that the actual State will in\n",
      "every respect coincide with the ideal: if we are only able to discover\n",
      "how a city may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that we\n",

      "I am sure that I should be contented--will not you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I will.\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, I quite understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then let me tell you my view about them. I do not see them, and\n",
      "therefore the distinctions of figure, colour, and the like, which enable\n",

      "speaking of a faculty I think only of its sphere and its result; and\n",
      "that which has the same sphere and the same result I call the same\n",
      "faculty, but that which has another sphere and another result I call\n",

      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will you be so very good as to answer one more question? Would you\n",
      "say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is opinion also a faculty?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form\n",
      "an opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not\n",
      "the same as opinion?\n",

      "is infallible with that which errs?\n",
      "\n",
      "An excellent answer, proving, I said, that we are quite conscious of a\n",
      "distinction between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct\n",

      "\n",
      "That is certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to\n",
      "know the nature of being?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And opinion is to have an opinion?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do we know what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion the\n",
      "same as the subject-matter of knowledge?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in\n",
      "faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject-matter, and if, as\n",
      "we were saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the\n",
      "sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.\n",

      "\n",
      "Well then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion? or, rather, how\n",
      "can there be an opinion at all about not-being? Reflect: when a man\n",
      "has an opinion, has he not an opinion about something? Can he have an\n",
      "opinion which is an opinion about nothing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "He who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",

      "And not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",

      "Not with either.\n",
      "\n",
      "And can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?\n",
      "\n",
      "That seems to be true.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in\n",

      "ignorance?\n",
      "\n",
      "In neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge,\n",

      "\n",
      "Both; and in no small degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "And also to be within and between them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?\n",
      "\n",
      "No question.\n",
      "\n",
      "But were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a sort\n",
      "which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would appear\n",
      "also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute not-being;\n",
      "and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance,\n",
      "but will be found in the interval between them?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in that interval there has now been discovered something which we\n",
      "call opinion?\n",
      "\n",
      "There has.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally\n",
      "of the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed\n",
      "either, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may\n",
      "truly call the subject of opinion, and assign each to their proper\n",
      "faculty,--the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to\n",
      "the faculty of the mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",

      "sights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the\n",
      "just is one, or that anything is one--to him I would appeal, saying,\n",
      "Will you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these\n",
      "beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly; or of the\n",

      "\n",
      "True; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of\n",

      "\n",
      "And can any one of those many things which are called by particular\n",
      "names be said to be this rather than not to be this?\n",

      "He replied: They are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts\n",
      "or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with\n",
      "what he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat\n",
      "was sitting. The individual objects of which I am speaking are also\n",
      "a riddle, and have a double sense: nor can you fix them in your mind,\n",
      "either as being or not-being, or both, or neither.\n",

      "that when, by continually attending upon him, he has become perfect in\n",

      "the State, making them his judges when he is not obliged, the so-called\n",

      "else, they may, perhaps, go and hear a lecture, and about this they make\n",
      "much ado, for philosophy is not considered by them to be their\n",
      "proper business: at last, when they grow old, in most cases they are\n",
      "extinguished more truly than Heracleitus' sun, inasmuch as they never\n",

      "this period while they are growing up towards manhood, the chief and\n",
      "special care should be given to their bodies that they may have them\n",
      "to use in the service of philosophy; as life advances and the intellect\n",

      "when the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military\n",
      "duties, then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour,\n",
      "as we intend them to live happily here, and to crown this life with a\n",

      "On the other hand, those steadfast natures which can better be depended\n",
      "upon, which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable, are\n",
      "equally immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are\n",
      "always in a torpid state, and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any\n",

      "\n",
      "Quite true.\n",

      "Yes, he said, you are quite right in testing him. But what do you mean\n",

      "\n",
      "We were saying, if I am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see them in\n",
      "their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way, at\n",
      "the end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular\n",
      "exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded.\n",
      "And you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you, and so\n",
      "the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate\n",
      "manner; whether you were satisfied or not, it is for you to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, I thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair\n",
      "measure of truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, my friend, I said, a measure of such things which in any degree\n",
      "falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing\n",
      "imperfect is the measure of anything, although persons are too apt to be\n",
      "contented and think that they need search no further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not an uncommon case when people are indolent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the\n",
      "State and of the laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guardian then, I said, must be required to take the longer circuit,\n",
      "and toil at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach\n",
      "the highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is his\n",
      "proper calling.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this--higher than\n",
      "justice and the other virtues?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, there is. And of the virtues too we must behold not the\n",
      "outline merely, as at present--nothing short of the most finished\n",
      "picture should satisfy us. When little things are elaborated with an\n",
      "infinity of pains, in order that they may appear in their full beauty\n",
      "and utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think the\n",
      "highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!\n",
      "\n",
      "A right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain from\n",
      "asking you what is this highest knowledge?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, I said, ask if you will; but I am certain that you have heard the\n",
      "answer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as I\n",
      "rather think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have often\n",
      "been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all\n",
      "other things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this.\n",
      "You can hardly be ignorant that of this I was about to speak, concerning\n",
      "which, as you have often heard me say, we know so little; and, without\n",
      "which, any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us\n",
      "nothing. Do you think that the possession of all other things is of\n",
      "any value if we do not possess the good? or the knowledge of all other\n",
      "things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuredly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good,\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by\n",
      "knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?\n",
      "\n",
      "How ridiculous!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance\n",
      "of the good, and then presume our knowledge of it--for the good they\n",
      "define to be knowledge of the good, just as if we understood them when\n",
      "they use the term 'good'--this is of course ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity; for they\n",
      "are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this\n",
      "question is involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be none.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to seem\n",
      "to be what is just and honourable without the reality; but no one is\n",
      "satisfied with the appearance of good--the reality is what they seek; in\n",
      "the case of the good, appearance is despised by every one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all\n",
      "his actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end, and\n",
      "yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same\n",
      "assurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever\n",
      "good there is in other things,--of a principle such and so great as this\n",
      "ought the best men in our State, to whom everything is entrusted, to be\n",
      "in the darkness of ignorance?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure, I said, that he who does not know how the beautiful and\n",
      "the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and\n",
      "I suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true\n",
      "knowledge of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will be\n",
      "perfectly ordered?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether you\n",
      "conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure,\n",
      "or different from either?\n",
      "\n",
      "Aye, I said, I knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would\n",
      "not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, Socrates; but I must say that one who like you has passed a\n",
      "lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the\n",
      "opinions of others, and never telling his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no right\n",
      "to do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the\n",
      "best of them blind? You would not deny that those who have any true\n",
      "notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way\n",
      "along the road?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when\n",
      "others will tell you of brightness and beauty?\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn away just\n",
      "as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an explanation\n",
      "of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the\n",
      "other virtues, we shall be satisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, my friend, and I shall be at least equally satisfied, but I cannot\n",
      "help fearing that I shall fail, and that my indiscreet zeal will bring\n",
      "ridicule upon me. No, sweet sirs, let us not at present ask what is the\n",
      "actual nature of the good, for to reach what is now in my thoughts\n",
      "would be an effort too great for me. But of the child of the good who\n",
      "is likest him, I would fain speak, if I could be sure that you wished to\n",
      "hear--otherwise, not.\n",
      "\n",
      "By all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall remain in\n",
      "our debt for the account of the parent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do indeed wish, I replied, that I could pay, and you receive, the\n",
      "account of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take,\n",
      "however, this latter by way of interest, and at the same time have a\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, we will take all the care that we can: proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, but I must first come to an understanding with you, and\n",
      "remind you of what I have mentioned in the course of this discussion,\n",
      "and at many other times.\n",
      "\n",
      "What?\n",
      "\n",
      "The old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and so\n",

      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and of other\n",
      "things to which the term 'many' is applied there is an absolute; for\n",
      "they may be brought under a single idea, which is called the essence of\n",
      "each.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "The many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas are known but\n",
      "not seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what is the organ with which we see the visible things?\n",

      "True.\n",

      "No, I never have, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional\n",

      "Nothing of the sort.\n",

      "in courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of\n",
      "images of justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those\n",
      "who have never yet seen absolute justice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Anything but surprising, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the\n",
      "eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out\n",
      "of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's\n",
      "eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when\n",
      "he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too\n",
      "ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out\n",
      "of the brighter life, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the\n",
      "dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess\n",
      "of light. And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of\n",
      "being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the\n",
      "soul which comes from below into the light, there will be more reason\n",
      "in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of\n",
      "the light into the den.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, he said, is a very just distinction.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong\n",
      "when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not\n",
      "there before, like sight into blind eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "They undoubtedly say this, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning\n",
      "exists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn\n",
      "from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of\n",
      "knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the\n",
      "world of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure\n",
      "the sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or in other\n",
      "words, of the good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the\n",
      "easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for\n",
      "that exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is\n",
      "looking away from the truth?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, such an art may be presumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to\n",
      "bodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate they can\n",
      "be implanted later by habit and exercise, the virtue of wisdom more than\n",
      "anything else contains a divine element which always remains, and by\n",
      "this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other\n",
      "hand, hurtful and useless. Did you never observe the narrow intelligence\n",
      "flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue--how eager he is, how\n",
      "clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is the reverse of\n",
      "blind, but his keen eye-sight is forced into the service of evil, and he\n",
      "is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days\n",
      "of their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures,\n",
      "such as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were attached\n",
      "to them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision\n",
      "of their souls upon the things that are below--if, I say, they had been\n",
      "released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction,\n",
      "the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as\n",
      "they see what their eyes are turned to now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely, or rather a\n",
      "necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated\n",
      "and uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end of\n",
      "their education, will be able ministers of State; not the former,\n",
      "because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their\n",
      "actions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will\n",
      "not act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already\n",
      "dwelling apart in the islands of the blest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State\n",
      "will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have\n",
      "already shown to be the greatest of all--they must continue to ascend\n",
      "until they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended and seen\n",
      "enough we must not allow them to do as they do now.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be\n",
      "allowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the\n",
      "den, and partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth\n",
      "having or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life,\n",
      "when they might have a better?\n",
      "\n",
      "You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the\n",
      "legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy\n",
      "above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he\n",
      "held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them\n",
      "benefactors of the State, and therefore benefactors of one another;\n",
      "to this end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his\n",
      "instruments in binding up the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said, I had forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Observe, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our\n",
      "philosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain\n",
      "to them that in other States, men of their class are not obliged to\n",
      "share in the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow up\n",
      "at their own sweet will, and the government would rather not have them.\n",
      "Being self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a\n",
      "culture which they have never received. But we have brought you into\n",
      "the world to be rulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the other\n",
      "citizens, and have educated you far better and more perfectly than they\n",
      "have been educated, and you are better able to share in the double duty.\n",
      "Wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down to the general\n",
      "underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the dark. When you\n",
      "have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand times better than the\n",
      "inhabitants of the den, and you will know what the several images are,\n",
      "and what they represent, because you have seen the beautiful and just\n",
      "and good in their truth. And thus our State, which is also yours, will\n",
      "be a reality, and not a dream only, and will be administered in a spirit\n",
      "unlike that of other States, in which men fight with one another about\n",
      "shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power, which in\n",
      "their eyes is a great good. Whereas the truth is that the State in which\n",
      "the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most\n",
      "quietly governed, and the State in which they are most eager, the worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at\n",
      "the toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of\n",
      "their time with one another in the heavenly light?\n",
      "\n",
      "Impossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands which\n",
      "we impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one of\n",
      "them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion of\n",
      "our present rulers of State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive for\n",
      "your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, and\n",
      "then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which\n",
      "offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold,\n",
      "but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas\n",
      "if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering\n",
      "after their own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to\n",
      "snatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they will be\n",
      "fighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus\n",
      "arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition\n",
      "is that of true philosophy. Do you know of any other?\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, I do not, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they\n",
      "are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.\n",
      "\n",
      "No question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? Surely they\n",
      "will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the\n",
      "State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours\n",
      "and another and a better life than that of politics?\n",
      "\n",
      "They are the men, and I will choose them, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced,\n",
      "and how they are to be brought from darkness to light,--as some are said\n",
      "to have ascended from the world below to the gods?\n",
      "\n",
      "By all means, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell (In\n",
      "allusion to a game in which two parties fled or pursued according as an\n",
      "oyster-shell which was thrown into the air fell with the dark or light\n",
      "side uppermost.), but the turning round of a soul passing from a day\n",
      "which is little better than night to the true day of being, that is, the\n",
      "ascent from below, which we affirm to be true philosophy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite so.\n",
      "\n",
      "And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of\n",
      "effecting such a change?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming\n",
      "to being? And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will\n",
      "remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that was said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?\n",
      "\n",
      "What quality?\n",
      "\n",
      "Usefulness in war.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the\n",
      "body, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and\n",
      "corruption?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?\n",
      "\n",
      "No.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent\n",
      "into our former scheme?\n",
      "\n",
      "Music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic,\n",
      "and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making\n",
      "them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and\n",
      "the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of\n",
      "rhythm and harmony in them. But in music there was nothing which tended\n",
      "to that good which you are now seeking.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are most accurate, I said, in your recollection; in music there\n",
      "certainly was nothing of the kind. But what branch of knowledge is\n",
      "there, my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the\n",
      "useful arts were reckoned mean by us?\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts\n",
      "are also excluded, what remains?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; and\n",
      "then we shall have to take something which is not special, but of\n",
      "universal application.\n",
      "\n",
      "What may that be?\n",
      "\n",
      "A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common,\n",
      "and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "The little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three--in a word,\n",
      "number and calculation:--do not all arts and sciences necessarily\n",
      "partake of them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the art of war partakes of them?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves Agamemnon\n",
      "ridiculously unfit to be a general. Did you never remark how he declares\n",
      "that he had invented number, and had numbered the ships and set in array\n",
      "the ranks of the army at Troy; which implies that they had never been\n",
      "numbered before, and Agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been\n",

      "What is your notion?\n",
      "\n",
      "It appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and\n",

      "Will you explain your meaning? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will try, I said; and I wish you would share the enquiry with me,\n",
      "and say 'yes' or 'no' when I attempt to distinguish in my own mind what\n",

      "not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them; while\n",
      "in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further\n",
      "enquiry is imperatively demanded.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses\n",
      "are imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, I said, that is not at all my meaning.\n",

      "or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its\n",
      "opposite. An illustration will make my meaning clearer:--here are three\n",
      "fingers--a little finger, a second finger, and a middle finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good.\n",
      "\n",

      "What is it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or\n",
      "at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin--it makes no\n",
      "difference; a finger is a finger all the same. In these cases a man is\n",
      "not compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger? for the\n",
      "sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore, I said, as we might expect, there is nothing here which\n",
      "invites or excites intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is not, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?\n",
      "Can sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the\n",
      "circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at\n",
      "the extremity? And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the\n",
      "qualities of thickness or thinness, of softness or hardness? And so of\n",
      "the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters? Is\n",
      "not their mode of operation on this wise--the sense which is concerned\n",
      "with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the\n",
      "quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing\n",
      "is felt to be both hard and soft?\n",
      "\n",
      "You are quite right, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense\n",

      "light and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is\n",
      "heavy, light?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very curious\n",
      "and require to be explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to her\n",
      "aid calculation and intelligence, that she may see whether the several\n",
      "objects announced to her are one or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",

      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whereas the thinking mind, intending to light up the chaos, was\n",

      "Most true.\n",

      "This was what I meant when I spoke of impressions which invited the\n",

      "involves the conception of plurality, then thought begins to be aroused\n",
      "within us, and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision\n",

      "Then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having a\n",
      "double use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn\n",
      "the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the\n",
      "philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and\n",

      "That is true.\n",

      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",

      "and we must endeavour to persuade those who are to be the principal men\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add how charming the\n",
      "science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if\n",

      "\n",
      "How do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating\n",
      "effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and\n",
      "rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into\n",
      "the argument. You know how steadily the masters of the art repel and\n",
      "ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is\n",
      "calculating, and if you divide, they multiply (Meaning either (1)\n",
      "that they integrate the number because they deny the possibility of\n",
      "fractions; or (2) that division is regarded by them as a process of\n",
      "multiplication, for the fractions of one continue to be units.), taking\n",
      "care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are these\n",
      "wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say,\n",
      "there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable,\n",
      "indivisible,--what would they answer?\n",
      "\n",
      "They would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking of\n",
      "those numbers which can only be realized in thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary,\n",
      "necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the\n",
      "attainment of pure truth?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent for\n",
      "calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and\n",
      "even the dull, if they have had an arithmetical training, although they\n",
      "may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than\n",
      "they would otherwise have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not\n",
      "many as difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will not.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which\n",
      "the best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let this then be made one of our subjects of education. And next, shall\n",
      "we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?\n",
      "\n",
      "You mean geometry?\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which\n",
      "relates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position,\n",
      "or closing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military\n",
      "manoeuvre, whether in actual battle or on a march, it will make all the\n",
      "difference whether a general is or is not a geometrician.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or\n",
      "calculation will be enough; the question relates rather to the greater\n",
      "and more advanced part of geometry--whether that tends in any degree\n",
      "to make more easy the vision of the idea of good; and thither, as I was\n",
      "saying, all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards\n",
      "that place, where is the full perfection of being, which she ought, by\n",
      "all means, to behold.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming\n",
      "only, it does not concern us?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that is what we assert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny\n",
      "that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the\n",
      "ordinary language of geometricians.\n",
      "\n",
      "How so?\n",
      "\n",
      "They have in view practice only, and are always speaking, in a narrow\n",
      "and ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the\n",
      "like--they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life;\n",
      "whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then must not a further admission be made?\n",
      "\n",
      "What admission?\n",
      "\n",
      "That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal,\n",
      "and not of aught perishing and transient.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth,\n",
      "and create the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now\n",
      "unhappily allowed to fall down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing will be more likely to have such an effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants\n",
      "of your fair city should by all means learn geometry. Moreover the\n",
      "science has indirect effects, which are not small.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of what kind? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are the military advantages of which you spoke, I said; and in all\n",
      "departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has studied\n",
      "geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our\n",
      "youth will study?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us do so, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And suppose we make astronomy the third--what do you say?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons\n",
      "and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the\n",
      "farmer or sailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am amused, I said, at your fear of the world, which makes you guard\n",
      "against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and I quite\n",
      "admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye\n",
      "of the soul which, when by other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these\n",
      "purified and re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand\n",
      "bodily eyes, for by it alone is truth seen. Now there are two classes of\n",
      "persons: one class of those who will agree with you and will take\n",
      "your words as a revelation; another class to whom they will be utterly\n",
      "unmeaning, and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales, for they\n",
      "see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them. And therefore\n",
      "you had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing to\n",
      "argue. You will very likely say with neither, and that your chief aim in\n",
      "carrying on the argument is your own improvement; at the same time you\n",
      "do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own\n",
      "behalf.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order of the\n",
      "sciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "What was the mistake? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "After plane geometry, I said, we proceeded at once to solids in\n",
      "revolution, instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the\n",
      "second dimension the third, which is concerned with cubes and dimensions\n",
      "of depth, ought to have followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is true, Socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet about\n",
      "these subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, yes, I said, and for two reasons:--in the first place, no\n",
      "government patronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the\n",
      "pursuit of them, and they are difficult; in the second place, students\n",
      "cannot learn them unless they have a director. But then a director\n",
      "can hardly be found, and even if he could, as matters now stand,\n",
      "the students, who are very conceited, would not attend to him. That,\n",
      "however, would be otherwise if the whole State became the director of\n",
      "these studies and gave honour to them; then disciples would want to\n",
      "come, and there would be continuous and earnest search, and discoveries\n",
      "would be made; since even now, disregarded as they are by the world, and\n",
      "maimed of their fair proportions, and although none of their votaries\n",
      "can tell the use of them, still these studies force their way by their\n",
      "natural charm, and very likely, if they had the help of the State, they\n",
      "would some day emerge into light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them. But I do not clearly\n",
      "understand the change in the order. First you began with a geometry of\n",
      "plane surfaces?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step backward?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, and I have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid\n",
      "geometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass\n",
      "over this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence\n",
      "if encouraged by the State, let us go on to astronomy, which will be\n",
      "fourth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The right order, he replied. And now, Socrates, as you rebuked the\n",
      "vulgar manner in which I praised astronomy before, my praise shall\n",
      "be given in your own spirit. For every one, as I think, must see that\n",
      "astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world\n",
      "to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one but myself, I said; to every one else this may be clear, but\n",
      "not to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what then would you say?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy\n",
      "appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "You, I replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our\n",
      "knowledge of the things above. And I dare say that if a person were to\n",
      "throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still think\n",
      "that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes. And you are very\n",
      "likely right, and I may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that\n",
      "knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul\n",
      "look upwards, and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the\n",
      "ground, seeking to learn some particular of sense, I would deny that he\n",
      "can learn, for nothing of that sort is matter of science; his soul is\n",
      "looking downwards, not upwards, whether his way to knowledge is by water\n",
      "or by land, whether he floats, or only lies on his back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. Still, I should like\n",
      "to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive\n",
      "to that knowledge of which we are speaking?\n",
      "\n",
      "I will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought\n",
      "upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most\n",
      "perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to\n",
      "the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are\n",
      "relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in\n",
      "them, in the true number and in every true figure. Now, these are to be\n",
      "apprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that\n",
      "higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures\n",
      "excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus, or some other great artist,\n",
      "which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw them would\n",
      "appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he would never\n",
      "dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true\n",
      "double, or the truth of any other proportion.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at\n",
      "the movements of the stars? Will he not think that heaven and the things\n",
      "in heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect manner?\n",
      "But he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, or of\n",
      "both to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the stars to these\n",
      "and to one another, and any other things that are material and visible\n",
      "can also be eternal and subject to no deviation--that would be absurd;\n",
      "and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their\n",
      "exact truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I quite agree, though I never thought of this before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems,\n",
      "and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right\n",
      "way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; and there are many other things which must also have a\n",
      "similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any\n",
      "value. But can you tell me of any other suitable study?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, he said, not without thinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Motion, I said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are\n",
      "obvious enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others,\n",
      "as I imagine, which may be left to wiser persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "But where are the two?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a second, I said, which is the counterpart of the one already\n",
      "named.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what may that be?\n",
      "\n",
      "The second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the\n",
      "first is to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed to\n",
      "look up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and\n",
      "these are sister sciences--as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon,\n",
      "agree with them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this, I said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better go\n",
      "and learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any other\n",
      "applications of these sciences. At the same time, we must not lose sight\n",
      "of our own higher object.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which our\n",
      "pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was saying\n",
      "that they did in astronomy. For in the science of harmony, as you\n",
      "probably know, the same thing happens. The teachers of harmony compare\n",
      "the sounds and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like\n",
      "that of the astronomers, is in vain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, by heaven! he said; and 'tis as good as a play to hear them talking\n",
      "about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their ears\n",
      "close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their\n",
      "neighbour's wall--one set of them declaring that they distinguish an\n",
      "intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be\n",
      "the unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds have\n",
      "passed into the same--either party setting their ears before their\n",
      "understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "You mean, I said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and\n",
      "rack them on the pegs of the instrument: I might carry on the metaphor\n",
      "and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives,\n",
      "and make accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and\n",
      "forwardness to sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore I will\n",
      "only say that these are not the men, and that I am referring to the\n",
      "Pythagoreans, of whom I was just now proposing to enquire about harmony.\n",
      "For they too are in error, like the astronomers; they investigate the\n",
      "numbers of the harmonies which are heard, but they never attain to\n",
      "problems--that is to say, they never reach the natural harmonies of\n",
      "number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "A thing, I replied, which I would rather call useful; that is, if sought\n",
      "after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in any other\n",
      "spirit, useless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and\n",
      "connection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual\n",
      "affinities, then, I think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them\n",
      "have a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suspect so; but you are speaking, Socrates, of a vast work.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean? I said; the prelude or what? Do you not know that all\n",
      "this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn? For\n",
      "you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician who was\n",
      "capable of reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason\n",
      "will have the knowledge which we require of them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither can this be supposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, Glaucon, I said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of\n",
      "dialectic. This is that strain which is of the intellect only, but which\n",
      "the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight,\n",
      "as you may remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold the\n",
      "real animals and stars, and last of all the sun himself. And so with\n",
      "dialectic; when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by\n",
      "the light of reason only, and without any assistance of sense, and\n",
      "perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception\n",
      "of the absolute good, he at last finds himself at the end of the\n",
      "intellectual world, as in the case of sight at the end of the visible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then this is the progress which you call dialectic?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation\n",
      "from the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from the\n",
      "underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly trying\n",
      "to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are able to\n",
      "perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water (which are\n",
      "divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows of images\n",
      "cast by a light of fire, which compared with the sun is only an\n",
      "image)--this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to\n",
      "the contemplation of that which is best in existence, with which we may\n",
      "compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body\n",
      "to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible\n",
      "world--this power is given, as I was saying, by all that study and\n",
      "pursuit of the arts which has been described.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to\n",
      "believe, yet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny. This,\n",
      "however, is not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but will have\n",
      "to be discussed again and again. And so, whether our conclusion be true\n",
      "or false, let us assume all this, and proceed at once from the prelude\n",
      "or preamble to the chief strain (A play upon the Greek word, which means\n",
      "both 'law' and 'strain.'), and describe that in like manner. Say, then,\n",
      "what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic, and what\n",
      "are the paths which lead thither; for these paths will also lead to our\n",
      "final rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Glaucon, I said, you will not be able to follow me here, though\n",
      "I would do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the\n",
      "absolute truth, according to my notion. Whether what I told you would\n",
      "or would not have been a reality I cannot venture to say; but you would\n",
      "have seen something like reality; of that I am confident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Doubtless, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can reveal\n",
      "this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.\n",
      "\n",
      "And assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method\n",
      "of comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of\n",
      "ascertaining what each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in\n",
      "general are concerned with the desires or opinions of men, or are\n",
      "cultivated with a view to production and construction, or for the\n",
      "preservation of such productions and constructions; and as to the\n",
      "mathematical sciences which, as we were saying, have some apprehension\n",
      "of true being--geometry and the like--they only dream about being,\n",
      "but never can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the\n",
      "hypotheses which they use unexamined, and are unable to give an account\n",
      "of them. For when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the\n",
      "conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows\n",
      "not what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever\n",
      "become science?\n",
      "\n",
      "Impossible, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first\n",
      "principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in\n",
      "order to make her ground secure; the eye of the soul, which is literally\n",
      "buried in an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards;\n",
      "and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion, the\n",
      "sciences which we have been discussing. Custom terms them sciences,\n",
      "but they ought to have some other name, implying greater clearness\n",
      "than opinion and less clearness than science: and this, in our previous\n",
      "sketch, was called understanding. But why should we dispute about names\n",
      "when we have realities of such importance to consider?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought\n",
      "of the mind with clearness?\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions;\n",
      "two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division\n",
      "science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth\n",
      "perception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and\n",
      "intellect with being; and so to make a proportion:--\n",
      "\n",
      "As being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion. And as\n",
      "intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to\n",
      "the perception of shadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects\n",
      "of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry, many times\n",
      "longer than this has been.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as I understand, he said, I agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one who\n",
      "attains a conception of the essence of each thing? And he who does not\n",
      "possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in\n",
      "whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in\n",
      "intelligence? Will you admit so much?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; how can I deny it?\n",
      "\n",
      "And you would say the same of the conception of the good? Until the\n",
      "person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good,\n",
      "and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready to\n",
      "disprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never\n",
      "faltering at any step of the argument--unless he can do all this, you\n",
      "would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he\n",
      "apprehends only a shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion\n",
      "and not by science;--dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he\n",
      "is well awake here, he arrives at the world below, and has his final\n",
      "quietus.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all that I should most certainly agree with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "And surely you would not have the children of your ideal State, whom you\n",
      "are nurturing and educating--if the ideal ever becomes a reality--you\n",
      "would not allow the future rulers to be like posts (Literally 'lines,'\n",
      "probably the starting-point of a race-course.), having no reason in\n",
      "them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",

      "questions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, you and I together will make it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences,\n",
      "and is set over them; no other science can be placed higher--the nature\n",
      "of knowledge can no further go?\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to\n",
      "be assigned, are questions which remain to be considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again given\n",
      "to the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, to the fairest; and,\n",
      "having noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural\n",
      "gifts which will facilitate their education.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what are these?\n",
      "\n",
      "Such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind\n",
      "more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of\n",
      "gymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind's own, and is not shared\n",
      "with the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, and be\n",
      "an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or he will\n",
      "never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go\n",
      "through all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no\n",
      "vocation, and this, as I was before saying, is the reason why she has\n",
      "fallen into disrepute: her true sons should take her by the hand and not\n",
      "bastards.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting\n",
      "industry--I mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle:\n",
      "as, for example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all\n",
      "other bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour\n",
      "of learning or listening or enquiring. Or the occupation to which he\n",
      "devotes himself may be of an opposite kind, and he may have the other\n",
      "sort of lameness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as to truth, I said, is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and\n",
      "lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at\n",
      "herself and others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary\n",
      "falsehood, and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire\n",
      "of ignorance, and has no shame at being detected?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and every\n",
      "other virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true son\n",
      "and the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities\n",
      "states and individuals unconsciously err; and the state makes a ruler,\n",
      "and the individual a friend, of one who, being defective in some part of\n",
      "virtue, is in a figure lame or a bastard.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these things, then, will have to be carefully considered by us; and\n",
      "if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and\n",
      "training are sound in body and mind, justice herself will have nothing\n",
      "to say against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and\n",
      "of the State; but, if our pupils are men of another stamp, the reverse\n",
      "will happen, and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on\n",
      "philosophy than she has to endure at present.\n",
      "\n",
      "That would not be creditable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not, I said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into\n",
      "earnest I am equally ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "In what respect?\n",
      "\n",
      "I had forgotten, I said, that we were not serious, and spoke with too\n",
      "much excitement. For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled\n",
      "under foot of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the\n",
      "authors of her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed! I was listening, and did not think so.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I, who am the speaker, felt that I was. And now let me remind you\n",
      "that, although in our former selection we chose old men, we must not do\n",
      "so in this. Solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he\n",
      "grows old may learn many things--for he can no more learn much than he\n",
      "can run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary toil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements of\n",
      "instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented\n",
      "to the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our\n",
      "system of education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of\n",
      "knowledge of any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm\n",
      "to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no\n",
      "hold on the mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, my good friend, I said, do not use compulsion, but let early\n",
      "education be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to find\n",
      "out the natural bent.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a very rational notion, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you remember that the children, too, were to be taken to see the\n",
      "battle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to be\n",
      "brought close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given\n",
      "them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I remember.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same practice may be followed, I said, in all these things--labours,\n",
      "lessons, dangers--and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be\n",
      "enrolled in a select number.\n",
      "\n",
      "At what age?\n",
      "\n",
      "At the age when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period whether of\n",
      "two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for\n",
      "any other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning;\n",
      "and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most\n",
      "important tests to which our youth are subjected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years\n",
      "old will be promoted to higher honour, and the sciences which they\n",
      "learned without any order in their early education will now be brought\n",
      "together, and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them\n",
      "to one another and to true being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting\n",
      "root.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion\n",
      "of dialectical talent: the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with you, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "These, I said, are the points which you must consider; and those who\n",
      "have most of this comprehension, and who are most steadfast in their\n",
      "learning, and in their military and other appointed duties, when they\n",
      "have arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the\n",
      "select class, and elevated to higher honour; and you will have to prove\n",
      "them by the help of dialectic, in order to learn which of them is able\n",
      "to give up the use of sight and the other senses, and in company with\n",
      "truth to attain absolute being: And here, my friend, great caution is\n",
      "required.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why great caution?\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has\n",
      "introduced?\n",
      "\n",
      "What evil? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The students of the art are filled with lawlessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in\n",
      "their case? or will you make allowance for them?\n",
      "\n",
      "In what way make allowance?\n",
      "\n",
      "I want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious son\n",
      "who is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and numerous\n",
      "family, and has many flatterers. When he grows up to manhood, he learns\n",
      "that his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he\n",
      "is unable to discover. Can you guess how he will be likely to behave\n",
      "towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the\n",
      "period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he\n",
      "knows? Or shall I guess for you?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be\n",
      "likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations\n",
      "more than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them when\n",
      "in need, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be less\n",
      "willing to disobey them in any important matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "He will.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he has made the discovery, I should imagine that he would\n",
      "diminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted\n",
      "to the flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase; he\n",
      "would now live after their ways, and openly associate with them, and,\n",
      "unless he were of an unusually good disposition, he would trouble\n",
      "himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, all that is very probable. But how is the image applicable to the\n",
      "disciples of philosophy?\n",
      "\n",
      "In this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice\n",
      "and honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental\n",
      "authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and\n",
      "attract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any sense of\n",
      "right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what\n",
      "is fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him,\n",
      "and then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is driven\n",
      "into believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable,\n",
      "or just and good any more than the reverse, and so of all the notions\n",
      "which he most valued, do you think that he will still honour and obey\n",
      "them as before?\n",
      "\n",
      "Impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore,\n",
      "and he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any life\n",
      "other than that which flatters his desires?\n",
      "\n",
      "He cannot.\n",
      "\n",
      "And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Unquestionably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I have\n",
      "described, and also, as I was just now saying, most excusable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; and, I may add, pitiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our\n",
      "citizens who are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in\n",
      "introducing them to dialectic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early; for\n",
      "youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the taste\n",
      "in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting and\n",
      "refuting others in imitation of those who refute them; like puppy-dogs,\n",
      "they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, there is nothing which they like better.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the hands\n",
      "of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing\n",
      "anything which they believed before, and hence, not only they, but\n",
      "philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the\n",
      "rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of such\n",
      "insanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth, and\n",
      "not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement; and the\n",
      "greater moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing\n",
      "the honour of the pursuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the\n",
      "disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now,\n",
      "any chance aspirant or intruder?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics\n",
      "and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice\n",
      "the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise--will that be\n",
      "enough?\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you say six or four years? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Say five years, I replied; at the end of the time they must be sent down\n",
      "again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office\n",
      "which young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will get their\n",
      "experience of life, and there will be an opportunity of trying whether,\n",
      "when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation, they will stand\n",
      "firm or flinch.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how long is this stage of their lives to last?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years of\n",

      "in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at\n",
      "last to their consummation: the time has now arrived at which they must\n",

      "things, and behold the absolute good; for that is the pattern according\n",
      "to which they are to order the State and the lives of individuals, and\n",
      "the remainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief\n",

      "There is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, that you\n",

      "the individuals corresponding to them, were worth examining. When we had\n",
      "seen all the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was the best and\n",
      "who was the worst of them, we were to consider whether the best was not\n",
      "also the happiest, and the worst the most miserable. I asked you\n",

      "I spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those of Crete\n",
      "and Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed oligarchy\n",
      "comes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of government\n",
      "which teems with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally follows\n",
      "oligarchy, although very different: and lastly comes tyranny, great\n",
      "and famous, which differs from them all, and is the fourth and worst\n",
      "disorder of a State. I do not know, do you? of any other constitution\n",
      "which can be said to have a distinct character. There are lordships and\n",
      "principalities which are bought and sold, and some other intermediate\n",
      "forms of government. But these are nondescripts and may be found equally\n",
      "among Hellenes and among barbarians.\n",

      "Yes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of government\n",
      "which exist among them.\n",

      "Do you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions of men\n",
      "vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the\n",

      "government other than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. We will compare\n",

      "In what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner will the\n",
      "two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with\n",
      "one another? Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to tell\n",
      "us 'how discord first arose'? Shall we imagine them in solemn mockery,\n",
      "to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address us in a\n",
      "lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?\n",
      "\n",
      "How would they address us?\n",
      "\n",
      "After this manner:--A city which is thus constituted can hardly be\n",
      "shaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an\n",
      "end, even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will\n",
      "in time be dissolved. And this is the dissolution:--In plants that grow\n",
      "in the earth, as well as in animals that move on the earth's surface,\n",
      "fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences\n",
      "of the circles of each are completed, which in short-lived existences\n",
      "pass over a short space, and in long-lived ones over a long space. But\n",
      "to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and\n",
      "education of your rulers will not attain; the laws which regulate them\n",
      "will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense,\n",
      "but will escape them, and they will bring children into the world when\n",
      "they ought not. Now that which is of divine birth has a period which is\n",
      "contained in a perfect number (i.e. a cyclical number, such as 6, which\n",
      "is equal to the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 3, so that when the circle\n",
      "or time represented by 6 is completed, the lesser times or rotations\n",
      "represented by 1, 2, 3 are also completed.), but the period of\n",
      "human birth is comprehended in a number in which first increments\n",
      "by involution and evolution (or squared and cubed) obtaining three\n",
      "intervals and four terms of like and unlike, waxing and waning numbers,\n",
      "make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another. (Probably\n",
      "the numbers 3, 4, 5, 6 of which the three first = the sides of the\n",
      "Pythagorean triangle. The terms will then be 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5 cubed,\n",
      "which together = 6 cubed = 216.) The base of these (3) with a third\n",
      "added (4) when combined with five (20) and raised to the third power\n",
      "furnishes two harmonies; the first a square which is a hundred times\n",
      "as great (400 = 4 x 100) (Or the first a square which is 100 x 100 =\n",
      "10,000. The whole number will then be 17,500 = a square of 100, and an\n",
      "oblong of 100 by 75.), and the other a figure having one side equal to\n",
      "the former, but oblong, consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon\n",
      "rational diameters of a square (i.e. omitting fractions), the side of\n",
      "which is five (7 x 7 = 49 x 100 = 4900), each of them being less by one\n",
      "(than the perfect square which includes the fractions, sc. 50) or less\n",
      "by (Or, 'consisting of two numbers squared upon irrational diameters,'\n",
      "etc. = 100. For other explanations of the passage see Introduction.) two\n",
      "perfect squares of irrational diameters (of a square the side of which\n",
      "is five = 50 + 50 = 100); and a hundred cubes of three (27 x 100 = 2700\n",
      "+ 4900 + 400 = 8000). Now this number represents a geometrical figure\n",
      "which has control over the good and evil of births. For when your\n",
      "guardians are ignorant of the law of births, and unite bride and\n",
      "bridegroom out of season, the children will not be goodly or\n",
      "fortunate. And though only the best of them will be appointed by their\n",
      "predecessors, still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places,\n",
      "and when they come into power as guardians, they will soon be found\n",
      "to fail in taking care of us, the Muses, first by under-valuing music;\n",
      "which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic; and hence the young men of\n",
      "your State will be less cultivated. In the succeeding generation rulers\n",
      "will be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal\n",
      "of your different races, which, like Hesiod's, are of gold and silver\n",
      "and brass and iron. And so iron will be mingled with silver, and brass\n",
      "with gold, and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and\n",
      "irregularity, which always and in all places are causes of hatred\n",
      "and war. This the Muses affirm to be the stock from which discord has\n",
      "sprung, wherever arising; and this is their answer to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, and we may assume that they answer truly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, yes, I said, of course they answer truly; how can the Muses speak\n",
      "falsely?\n",
      "\n",
      "And what do the Muses say next?\n",
      "\n",
      "When discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: the\n",
      "iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and\n",
      "silver; but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the\n",
      "true riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the ancient\n",
      "order of things. There was a battle between them, and at last they\n",
      "agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual owners;\n",
      "and they enslaved their friends and maintainers, whom they had formerly\n",
      "protected in the condition of freemen, and made of them subjects and\n",
      "servants; and they themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch\n",
      "against them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate\n",
      "between oligarchy and aristocracy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will\n",
      "they proceed? Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between oligarchy\n",
      "and the perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the other, and\n",
      "will also have some peculiarities.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class\n",
      "from agriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution\n",
      "of common meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military\n",
      "training--in all these respects this State will resemble the former.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they are no\n",
      "longer to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements;\n",
      "and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters, who\n",
      "are by nature fitted for war rather than peace; and in the value set\n",
      "by them upon military stratagems and contrivances, and in the waging of\n",
      "everlasting wars--this State will be for the most part peculiar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of money, like those\n",
      "who live in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing after\n",
      "gold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having magazines\n",
      "and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them;\n",
      "also castles which are just nests for their eggs, and in which they will\n",
      "spend large sums on their wives, or on any others whom they please.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is most true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the\n",
      "money which they prize; they will spend that which is another man's on\n",
      "the gratification of their desires, stealing their pleasures and running\n",
      "away like children from the law, their father: they have been schooled\n",
      "not by gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected her\n",
      "who is the true Muse, the companion of reason and philosophy, and have\n",
      "honoured gymnastic more than music.\n",
      "\n",
      "Undoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is a\n",
      "mixture of good and evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, there is a mixture, I said; but one thing, and one thing only, is\n",
      "predominantly seen,--the spirit of contention and ambition; and these\n",
      "are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuredly, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such is the origin and such the character of this State, which has been\n",
      "described in outline only; the more perfect execution was not required,\n",
      "for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and\n",
      "most perfectly unjust; and to go through all the States and all the\n",
      "characters of men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable\n",
      "labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into\n",
      "being, and what is he like?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, said Adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which\n",
      "characterises him, he is not unlike our friend Glaucon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps, I said, he may be like him in that one point; but there are\n",
      "other respects in which he is very different.\n",
      "\n",
      "In what respects?\n",
      "\n",
      "He should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet\n",
      "a friend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker.\n",
      "Such a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated man,\n",
      "who is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen, and\n",
      "remarkably obedient to authority; he is a lover of power and a lover of\n",
      "honour; claiming to be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or on any\n",
      "ground of that sort, but because he is a soldier and has performed feats\n",
      "of arms; he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that is the type of character which answers to timocracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an one will despise riches only when he is young; but as he gets\n",
      "older he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a\n",
      "piece of the avaricious nature in him, and is not single-minded towards\n",
      "virtue, having lost his best guardian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who was that? said Adeimantus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philosophy, I said, tempered with music, who comes and takes up her\n",
      "abode in a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, I said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the timocratical\n",
      "State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "His origin is as follows:--He is often the young son of a brave father,\n",
      "who dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours\n",
      "and offices, and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way, but is\n",
      "ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how does the son come into being?\n",
      "\n",
      "The character of the son begins to develope when he hears his mother\n",
      "complaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which\n",
      "the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women.\n",
      "Further, when she sees her husband not very eager about money, and\n",
      "instead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly, taking\n",
      "whatever happens to him quietly; and when she observes that his thoughts\n",
      "always centre in himself, while he treats her with very considerable\n",
      "indifference, she is annoyed, and says to her son that his father is\n",
      "only half a man and far too easy-going: adding all the other complaints\n",
      "about her own ill-treatment which women are so fond of rehearsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, said Adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints\n",
      "are so like themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you know, I said, that the old servants also, who are supposed to\n",
      "be attached to the family, from time to time talk privately in the same\n",
      "strain to the son; and if they see any one who owes money to his father,\n",
      "or is wronging him in any way, and he fails to prosecute them, they tell\n",
      "the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this\n",
      "sort, and be more of a man than his father. He has only to walk abroad\n",
      "and he hears and sees the same sort of thing: those who do their own\n",
      "business in the city are called simpletons, and held in no esteem, while\n",
      "the busy-bodies are honoured and applauded. The result is that the young\n",
      "man, hearing and seeing all these things--hearing, too, the words of\n",
      "his father, and having a nearer view of his way of life, and making\n",
      "comparisons of him and others--is drawn opposite ways: while his father\n",
      "is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul, the\n",
      "others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive; and he being not\n",
      "originally of a bad nature, but having kept bad company, is at last\n",
      "brought by their joint influence to a middle point, and gives up the\n",
      "kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness\n",
      "and passion, and becomes arrogant and ambitious.\n",
      "\n",
      "You seem to me to have described his origin perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we have now, I said, the second form of government and the second\n",
      "type of character?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, let us look at another man who, as Aeschylus says,\n",
      "\n",
      "'Is set over against another State;'\n",
      "\n",
      "or rather, as our plan requires, begin with the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "By all means.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that oligarchy follows next in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what manner of government do you term oligarchy?\n",
      "\n",
      "A government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich have\n",
      "power and the poor man is deprived of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ought I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to\n",
      "oligarchy arises?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I said, no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes\n",
      "into the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "How?\n",
      "\n",
      "The accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the\n",
      "ruin of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what do\n",
      "they or their wives care about the law?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival him, and thus the\n",
      "great mass of the citizens become lovers of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Likely enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making\n",
      "a fortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are\n",
      "placed together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as\n",
      "the other falls.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the State,\n",
      "virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour is\n",
      "neglected.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is obvious.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become\n",
      "lovers of trade and money; they honour and look up to the rich man, and\n",
      "make a ruler of him, and dishonour the poor man.\n",
      "\n",
      "They do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "They next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the\n",
      "qualification of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower\n",
      "in another, as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow\n",
      "no one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in\n",
      "the government. These changes in the constitution they effect by force\n",
      "of arms, if intimidation has not already done their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is\n",
      "established.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of\n",
      "government, and what are the defects of which we were speaking?\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification. Just\n",
      "think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their\n",
      "property, and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though\n",
      "he were a better pilot?\n",
      "\n",
      "You mean that they would shipwreck?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; and is not this true of the government of anything?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should imagine so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Except a city?--or would you include a city?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch as\n",
      "the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And here is another defect which is quite as bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "What defect?\n",
      "\n",
      "The inevitable division: such a State is not one, but two States, the\n",
      "one of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same spot\n",
      "and always conspiring against one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, surely, is at least as bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they are\n",
      "incapable of carrying on any war. Either they arm the multitude, and\n",
      "then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do not\n",
      "call them out in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed, few to\n",
      "fight as they are few to rule. And at the same time their fondness for\n",
      "money makes them unwilling to pay taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "How discreditable!\n",
      "\n",
      "And, as we said before, under such a constitution the same persons have\n",
      "too many callings--they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all in one.\n",
      "Does that look well?\n",
      "\n",
      "Anything but well.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is another evil which is, perhaps, the greatest of all, and to\n",
      "which this State first begins to be liable.\n",
      "\n",
      "What evil?\n",
      "\n",
      "A man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property;\n",
      "yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a\n",
      "part, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but\n",
      "only a poor, helpless creature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that is an evil which also first begins in this State.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both the\n",
      "extremes of great wealth and utter poverty.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "But think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money,\n",
      "was a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes\n",
      "of citizenship? Or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling\n",
      "body, although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a\n",
      "spendthrift?\n",
      "\n",
      "As you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a spendthrift.\n",
      "\n",
      "May we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone\n",
      "in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city as the\n",
      "other is of the hive?\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so, Socrates.\n",
      "\n",
      "And God has made the flying drones, Adeimantus, all without stings,\n",
      "whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others\n",
      "have dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who in their old\n",
      "age end as paupers; of the stingers come all the criminal class, as they\n",
      "are termed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly then, whenever you see paupers in a State, somewhere in that\n",
      "neighborhood there are hidden away thieves, and cut-purses and robbers\n",
      "of temples, and all sorts of malefactors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find paupers?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.\n",
      "\n",
      "And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to\n",
      "be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are\n",
      "careful to restrain by force?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, we may be so bold.\n",
      "\n",
      "The existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education,\n",
      "ill-training, and an evil constitution of the State?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and there\n",
      "may be many other evils.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are\n",
      "elected for their wealth, may now be dismissed. Let us next proceed to\n",
      "consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this\n",
      "State.\n",
      "\n",
      "By all means.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?\n",
      "\n",
      "How?\n",
      "\n",
      "A time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first\n",
      "he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but\n",
      "presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the State as upon\n",
      "a sunken reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been\n",
      "a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a\n",
      "prejudice raised by informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or\n",
      "deprived of the privileges of a citizen, and all his property taken from\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing more likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the son has seen and known all this--he is a ruined man, and his\n",
      "fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion headforemost from his\n",
      "bosom's throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making and by mean\n",
      "and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. Is not such\n",
      "an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the\n",
      "vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt\n",
      "with tiara and chain and scimitar?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently\n",
      "on either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know their place,\n",
      "he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into\n",
      "larger ones, and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything\n",
      "but riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything so much as the\n",
      "acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as the\n",
      "conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the\n",
      "State out of which oligarchy came.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon\n",
      "wealth?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only\n",
      "satisfies his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to them;\n",
      "his other desires he subdues, under the idea that they are unprofitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes a\n",
      "purse for himself; and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud.\n",
      "Is he not a true image of the State which he represents?\n",
      "\n",
      "He appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by him as\n",
      "well as by the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see that he is not a man of cultivation, I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "I imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have made a\n",
      "blind god director of his chorus, or given him chief honour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent! I said. Yet consider: Must we not further admit that owing to\n",
      "this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as\n",
      "of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his general habit\n",
      "of life?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his\n",
      "rogueries?\n",
      "\n",
      "Where must I look?\n",
      "\n",
      "You should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting\n",
      "dishonestly, as in the guardianship of an orphan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aye.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give\n",
      "him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced\n",
      "virtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by\n",
      "reason, but by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he\n",
      "trembles for his possessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires\n",
      "of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend\n",
      "what is not his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, and they will be strong in him too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, and not\n",
      "one; but, in general, his better desires will be found to prevail over\n",
      "his inferior ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people;\n",
      "yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far\n",
      "away and never come near him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should expect so.\n",
      "\n",
      "And surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a\n",
      "State for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition;\n",
      "he will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is he of\n",
      "awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in\n",
      "the struggle; in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part\n",
      "only of his resources, and the result commonly is that he loses the\n",
      "prize and saves his money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers to\n",
      "the oligarchical State?\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be no doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to\n",
      "be considered by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the\n",
      "democratic man, and bring him up for judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "That, he said, is our method.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy\n",
      "arise? Is it not on this wise?--The good at which such a State aims is\n",
      "to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?\n",
      "\n",
      "What then?\n",
      "\n",
      "The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse\n",
      "to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because\n",
      "they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their\n",
      "estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of\n",
      "moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any\n",
      "considerable extent; one or the other will be disregarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is tolerably clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness and\n",
      "extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to beggary?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, often.\n",
      "\n",
      "And still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting and\n",
      "fully armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their\n",
      "citizenship; a third class are in both predicaments; and they hate\n",
      "and conspire against those who have got their property, and against\n",
      "everybody else, and are eager for revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and\n",
      "pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert\n",
      "their sting--that is, their money--into some one else who is not on\n",
      "his guard against them, and recover the parent sum many times over\n",
      "multiplied into a family of children: and so they make drone and pauper\n",
      "to abound in the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, there are plenty of them--that is certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either\n",
      "by restricting a man's use of his own property, or by another remedy:\n",
      "\n",
      "What other?\n",
      "\n",
      "One which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the\n",
      "citizens to look to their characters:--Let there be a general rule that\n",
      "every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and\n",
      "there will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of\n",
      "which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, they will be greatly lessened.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present the governors, induced by the motives which I have named,\n",
      "treat their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially\n",
      "the young men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life\n",
      "of luxury and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are\n",
      "incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "They themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent as\n",
      "the pauper to the cultivation of virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, quite as indifferent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such is the state of affairs which prevails among them. And often rulers\n",
      "and their subjects may come in one another's way, whether on a journey\n",
      "or on some other occasion of meeting, on a pilgrimage or a march,\n",
      "as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye and they may observe the\n",
      "behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger--for where danger\n",
      "is, there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich--and\n",
      "very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the\n",
      "side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has\n",
      "plenty of superfluous flesh--when he sees such an one puffing and at his\n",
      "wits'-end, how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are\n",
      "only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them? And when they\n",
      "meet in private will not people be saying to one another 'Our warriors\n",
      "are not good for much'?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without\n",
      "may bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no external\n",
      "provocation a commotion may arise within--in the same way wherever there\n",
      "is weakness in the State there is also likely to be illness, of which\n",
      "the occasion may be very slight, the one party introducing from without\n",
      "their oligarchical, the other their democratical allies, and then\n",
      "the State falls sick, and is at war with herself; and may be at times\n",
      "distracted, even when there is no external cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, surely.\n",
      "\n",

      "It must be so.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the\n",

      "Yes, he said, the change in him is visible enough.\n",

      "fortunate, and is not too much disordered in his wits, when years have\n",
      "elapsed, and the heyday of passion is over--supposing that he then\n",
      "re-admits into the city some part of the exiled virtues, and does not\n",
      "wholly give himself up to their successors--in that case he balances his\n",
      "pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium, putting the government of\n",
      "himself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn;\n",
      "and when he has had enough of that, then into the hands of another; he\n",

      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of\n",
      "advice; if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions\n",
      "of good and noble desires, and others of evil desires, and that he ought\n",
      "to use and honour some and chastise and master the others--whenever this\n",
      "is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike,\n",
      "and that one is as good as another.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; that is the way with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the\n",

      "he becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes a turn\n",
      "at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then once\n",
      "more living the life of a philosopher; often he is busy with politics,\n",
      "and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head;\n",
      "and, if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is in that\n",
      "direction, or of men of business, once more in that. His life has\n",
      "neither law nor order; and this distracted existence he terms joy and\n",
      "bliss and freedom; and so he goes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the\n",
      "lives of many;--he answers to the State which we described as fair\n",
      "and spangled. And many a man and many a woman will take him for their\n",
      "pattern, and many a constitution and many an example of manners is\n",

      "\n",
      "Say then, my friend, In what manner does tyranny arise?--that it has a\n",
      "democratic origin is evident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as\n",
      "democracy from oligarchy--I mean, after a sort?\n",
      "\n",
      "How?\n",
      "\n",
      "The good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it\n",
      "was maintained was excess of wealth--am I not right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things\n",
      "for the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings\n",
      "her to dissolution?\n",
      "\n",
      "What good?\n",
      "\n",
      "Freedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the glory\n",
      "of the State--and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman\n",
      "of nature deign to dwell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; the saying is in every body's mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the\n",
      "neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy, which\n",
      "occasions a demand for tyranny.\n",
      "\n",
      "How so?\n",
      "\n",
      "When a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cup-bearers\n",
      "presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of\n",
      "freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful\n",
      "draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that they\n",
      "are cursed oligarchs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he replied, a very common occurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who\n",
      "hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are like\n",
      "rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are men after her own\n",
      "heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public. Now, in\n",
      "such a State, can liberty have any limit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "By degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by\n",
      "getting among the animals and infecting them.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his\n",
      "sons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he\n",
      "having no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is\n",
      "his freedom, and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen\n",
      "with the metic, and the stranger is quite as good as either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that is the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "And these are not the only evils, I said--there are several lesser ones:\n",
      "In such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars,\n",
      "and the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old are\n",
      "all alike; and the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready\n",
      "to compete with him in word or deed; and old men condescend to the\n",
      "young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be thought\n",
      "morose and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the manners of the\n",
      "young.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money,\n",
      "whether male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser; nor\n",

      "relation to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips?\n",
      "\n",
      "That is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who\n",
      "does not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the\n",
      "animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in\n",
      "any other State: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as\n",
      "good as their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of\n",
      "marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen; and they\n",

      "As we might expect.\n",

      "Well, I said, I meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts,\n",

      "\n",
      "A very just comparison.\n",
      "\n",
      "These two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, by all means, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us imagine\n",
      "democracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into three classes; for in the\n",
      "first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than\n",
      "there were in the oligarchical State.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is true.\n",

      "And in the democracy they are certainly more intensified.\n",
      "\n",
      "How so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven from\n",
      "office, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas in a\n",
      "democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the keener\n",
      "sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not\n",
      "suffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies almost\n",
      "everything is managed by the drones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",

      "\n",
      "They are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of\n",

      "\n",
      "Why, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of people who have\n",
      "little.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is pretty much the case, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people are a third class, consisting of those who work with their\n",
      "own hands; they are not politicians, and have not much to live upon.\n",
      "This, when assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a\n",
      "democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate\n",
      "unless they get a little honey.\n",
      "\n",
      "And do they not share? I said. Do not their leaders deprive the rich\n",

      "\n",

      "them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the end is that when they see the people, not of their own accord,\n",
      "but through ignorance, and because they are deceived by informers,\n",
      "seeking to do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become\n",
      "oligarchs in reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the\n",
      "drones torments them and breeds revolution in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is exactly the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another.\n",

      "\n",
      "What tale?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely at\n",
      "his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen;\n",
      "by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court\n",
      "and murders them, making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy\n",
      "tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizens; some he kills\n",
      "and others he banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of\n",
      "debts and partition of lands: and after this, what will be his destiny?\n",
      "Must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies, or from being a\n",
      "man become a wolf--that is, a tyrant?\n",
      "\n",
      "Inevitably.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, I said, is he who begins to make a party against the rich?\n",

      "The same.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his enemies,\n",
      "a tyrant full grown.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to death by\n",
      "a public accusation, they conspire to assassinate him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that is their usual way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then comes the famous request for a body-guard, which is the device of\n",
      "all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career--'Let not the\n",
      "people's friend,' as they say, 'be lost to them.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Of course.\n",

      "but tyrant absolute.\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt, he said.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "At first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and\n",
      "he salutes every one whom he meets;--he to be called a tyrant, who is\n",
      "making promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and\n",
      "distributing land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so\n",
      "kind and good to every one!\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and\n",
      "there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some\n",
      "war or other, in order that the people may require a leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Has he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished\n",
      "by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their\n",
      "daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom,\n",
      "and of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for\n",
      "destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all\n",
      "these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war.\n",
      "\n",
      "He must.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now he begins to grow unpopular.\n",
      "\n",
      "A necessary result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power,\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, that may be expected.\n",

      "\n",
      "He cannot.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who is\n",
      "high-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; happy man, he is the enemy\n",
      "of them all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no,\n",
      "until he has made a purgation of the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, and a rare purgation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the\n",
      "body; for they take away the worse and leave the better part, but he\n",
      "does the reverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "If he is to rule, I suppose that he cannot help himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a blessed alternative, I said:--to be compelled to dwell only with\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, that is the alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more\n",
      "satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?\n",
      "\n",
      "They will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if he pays them.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the dog! I said, here are more drones, of every sort and from every\n",
      "land.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, there are.\n",

      "How do you mean?\n",

      "\n",
      "To be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of all.\n",
      "\n",
      "What a blessed creature, I said, must this tyrant be; he has put to\n",
      "death the others and has these for his trusted friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; they are quite of his sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, and these are the new citizens whom he has called into\n",
      "existence, who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate\n",

      "Of course.\n",

      "Verily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and Euripides a great tragedian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why so?\n",

      "\n",
      "'Tyrants are wise by living with the wise;'\n",
      "\n",
      "and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes\n",
      "his companions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, and he also praises tyranny as godlike; and many other\n",
      "things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets.\n",
      "\n",
      "And therefore, I said, the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us\n",
      "and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into\n",

      "Very true.\n",

      "Moreover, they are paid for this and receive honour--the greatest\n",

      "their reputation fails, and seems unable from shortness of breath to\n",
      "proceed further.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we are wandering from the subject: Let us therefore return and\n",
      "enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various\n",
      "and ever-changing army of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he will confiscate\n",

      "\n",
      "And when these fail?\n",
      "\n",

      "Yes, he said; they cannot help themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up son\n",
      "ought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should be\n",
      "supported by the son? The father did not bring him into being, or settle\n",
      "him in life, in order that when his son became a man he should himself\n",
      "be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble\n",

      "by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and\n",
      "aristocratic, as they are termed. And so he bids him and his companions\n",

      "\n",
      "By heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what a monster he has\n",

      "Very true, I said; and observe the point which I want to understand:\n",
      "Certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be\n",
      "unlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are\n",
      "controlled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail\n",

      "while in the case of others they are stronger, and there are more of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which appetites do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling\n",
      "power is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or\n",
      "drink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy\n",
      "his desires; and there is no conceivable folly or crime--not excepting\n",
      "incest or any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of\n",
      "forbidden food--which at such a time, when he has parted company with\n",
      "all shame and sense, a man may not be ready to commit.\n",

      "thoughts and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having\n",
      "first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but just\n",
      "enough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and\n",
      "pains from interfering with the higher principle--which he leaves in\n",
      "the solitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire to\n",
      "the knowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future: when\n",
      "again he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel against\n",
      "any one--I say, when, after pacifying the two irrational principles, he\n",
      "rouses up the third, which is reason, before he takes his rest, then,\n",

      "Yes, I agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic\n",

      "of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures. After this\n",
      "manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, I said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive this\n",
      "man, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his father's\n",
      "principles.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can imagine him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son\n",
      "which has already happened to the father:--he is drawn into a perfectly\n",
      "lawless life, which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty; and his\n",
      "father and friends take part with his moderate desires, and the opposite\n",
      "party assist the opposite ones. As soon as these dire magicians and\n",
      "tyrant-makers find that they are losing their hold on him, they contrive\n",
      "to implant in him a master passion, to be lord over his idle and\n",
      "spendthrift lusts--a sort of monstrous winged drone--that is the only\n",
      "image which will adequately describe him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and\n",
      "garlands and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let\n",
      "loose, come buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of\n",
      "desire which they implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this\n",
      "lord of the soul, having Madness for the captain of his guard, breaks\n",
      "out into a frenzy: and if he finds in himself any good opinions or\n",
      "appetites in process of formation, and there is in him any sense of\n",
      "shame remaining, to these better principles he puts an end, and casts\n",
      "them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to\n",
      "the full.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should not wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?\n",
      "\n",
      "He has.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will\n",
      "fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the\n",
      "gods?\n",
      "\n",
      "That he will.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being\n",
      "when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he\n",
      "becomes drunken, lustful, passionate? O my friend, is not that so?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuredly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such is the man and such is his origin. And next, how does he live?\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I imagine, I said, at the next step in his progress, that there will be\n",
      "feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort\n",
      "of thing; Love is the lord of the house within him, and orders all the\n",
      "concerns of his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable,\n",
      "and their demands are many.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are indeed, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "His revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then comes debt and the cutting down of his property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest\n",
      "like young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by them,\n",
      "and especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them,\n",
      "is in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil\n",
      "of his property, in order that he may gratify them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that is sure to be the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "He must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains and\n",
      "pangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He must.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new got\n",
      "the better of the old and took away their rights, so he being younger\n",
      "will claim to have more than his father and his mother, and if he has\n",
      "spent his own share of the property, he will take a slice of theirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt he will.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all to\n",
      "cheat and deceive them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if he fails, then he will use force and plunder them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, probably.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?\n",
      "Will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, O heavens! Adeimantus, on account of some new-fangled love of a\n",
      "harlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe that\n",
      "he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary\n",
      "to his very existence, and would place her under the authority of the\n",
      "other, when she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under\n",
      "like circumstances, he would do the same to his withered old father,\n",
      "first and most indispensable of friends, for the sake of some\n",
      "newly-found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.\n",
      "\n",
      "Truly, then, I said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and\n",
      "mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is indeed, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "He first takes their property, and when that fails, and pleasures are\n",
      "beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a house,\n",
      "or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he proceeds to\n",
      "clear a temple. Meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child,\n",
      "and which gave judgment about good and evil, are overthrown by those\n",
      "others which have just been emancipated, and are now the body-guard of\n",
      "love and share his empire. These in his democratic days, when he was\n",
      "still subject to the laws and to his father, were only let loose in\n",
      "the dreams of sleep. But now that he is under the dominion of love, he\n",
      "becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in\n",
      "a dream only; he will commit the foulest murder, or eat forbidden food,\n",
      "or be guilty of any other horrid act. Love is his tyrant, and lives\n",
      "lordly in him and lawlessly, and being himself a king, leads him on, as\n",
      "a tyrant leads a State, to the performance of any reckless deed by which\n",
      "he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates, whether those\n",
      "whom evil communications have brought in from without, or those whom\n",
      "he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar\n",
      "evil nature in himself. Have we not here a picture of his way of life?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, indeed, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if there are only a few of them in the State, and the rest of the\n",
      "people are well disposed, they go away and become the body-guard or\n",
      "mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a\n",
      "war; and if there is no war, they stay at home and do many little pieces\n",
      "of mischief in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "What sort of mischief?\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, they are the thieves, burglars, cut-purses, foot-pads,\n",
      "robbers of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able\n",
      "to speak they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take bribes.\n",
      "\n",
      "A small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are few in\n",
      "number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all these\n",
      "things, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State, do not\n",
      "come within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class and\n",
      "their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength,\n",
      "assisted by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among\n",
      "themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul, and him\n",
      "they create their tyrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he began\n",
      "by beating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the power, he\n",
      "beats them, and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland, as the\n",
      "Cretans say, in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced\n",
      "to be their rulers and masters. This is the end of his passions and\n",
      "desires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "When such men are only private individuals and before they get power,\n",
      "this is their character; they associate entirely with their own\n",
      "flatterers or ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they\n",
      "in their turn are equally ready to bow down before them: they profess\n",
      "every sort of affection for them; but when they have gained their point\n",
      "they know them no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, truly.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of\n",
      "anybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "And may we not rightly call such men treacherous?\n",
      "\n",
      "No question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of justice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, and we were perfectly right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us then sum up in a word, I said, the character of the worst man: he\n",
      "is the waking reality of what we dreamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and the\n",
      "longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is certain, said Glaucon, taking his turn to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "And will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the most\n",
      "miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually\n",
      "and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in\n",
      "general?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, inevitably.\n",
      "\n",
      "And must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical State, and\n",
      "the democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the\n",
      "others?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation\n",
      "to man?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city\n",
      "which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?\n",
      "\n",
      "They are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best and\n",
      "the other is the very worst.\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be no mistake, I said, as to which is which, and therefore\n",
      "I will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision\n",
      "about their relative happiness and misery. And here we must not allow\n",
      "ourselves to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is\n",
      "only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us\n",
      "go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about, and\n",
      "then we will give our opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fair invitation, he replied; and I see, as every one must, that a\n",
      "tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king\n",
      "the happiest.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request,\n",
      "that I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through\n",
      "human nature? he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and\n",
      "is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to\n",
      "the beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight. May I suppose\n",
      "that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able\n",
      "to judge, and has dwelt in the same place with him, and been present at\n",
      "his dally life and known him in his family relations, where he may be\n",
      "seen stripped of his tragedy attire, and again in the hour of public\n",
      "danger--he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant\n",
      "when compared with other men?\n",
      "\n",
      "That again, he said, is a very fair proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and\n",
      "have before now met with such a person? We shall then have some one who\n",
      "will answer our enquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "By all means.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the\n",
      "State; bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other\n",
      "of them, will you tell me their respective conditions?\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean? he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city which is\n",
      "governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved?\n",
      "\n",
      "No city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a\n",
      "State?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, I see that there are--a few; but the people, speaking\n",
      "generally, and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule\n",
      "prevail? his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity--the best elements\n",
      "in him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also the\n",
      "worst and maddest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inevitably.\n",
      "\n",
      "And would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman,\n",
      "or of a slave?\n",
      "\n",
      "He has the soul of a slave, in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of\n",
      "acting voluntarily?\n",
      "\n",
      "Utterly incapable.\n",
      "\n",
      "And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul\n",
      "taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there is a\n",
      "gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And must not such a State and such a man be always full of fear?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow\n",
      "and groaning and pain?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery\n",
      "than in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?\n",
      "\n",
      "Impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State\n",
      "to be the most miserable of States?\n",
      "\n",
      "And I was right, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, I said. And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical\n",
      "man, what do you say of him?\n",
      "\n",
      "I say that he is by far the most miserable of all men.\n",
      "\n",
      "There, I said, I think that you are beginning to go wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then who is more miserable?\n",
      "\n",
      "One of whom I am about to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "He who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private life\n",
      "has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what has been said, I gather that you are right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more\n",
      "certain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this\n",
      "respecting good and evil is the greatest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me then offer you an illustration, which may, I think, throw a light\n",
      "upon this subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is your illustration?\n",
      "\n",
      "The case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from\n",
      "them you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have\n",
      "slaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that is the difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from\n",
      "their servants?\n",
      "\n",
      "What should they fear?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing. But do you observe the reason of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the\n",
      "protection of each individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, I said. But imagine one of these owners, the master say of\n",
      "some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves,\n",
      "carried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to\n",
      "help him--will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and\n",
      "children should be put to death by his slaves?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his\n",
      "slaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things, much\n",
      "against his will--he will have to cajole his own servants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that will be the only way of saving himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "And suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him with\n",
      "neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and\n",
      "who, if they could catch the offender, would take his life?\n",
      "\n",
      "His case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere\n",
      "surrounded and watched by enemies.\n",
      "\n",
      "And is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound--he\n",
      "who being by nature such as we have described, is full of all sorts of\n",
      "fears and lusts? His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone, of all\n",
      "men in the city, he is never allowed to go on a journey, or to see the\n",
      "things which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole like\n",
      "a woman hidden in the house, and is jealous of any other citizen who\n",
      "goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his own\n",
      "person--the tyrannical man, I mean--whom you just now decided to be the\n",
      "most miserable of all--will not he be yet more miserable when, instead\n",
      "of leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a public\n",
      "tyrant? He has to be master of others when he is not master of himself:\n",
      "he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his\n",
      "life, not in retirement, but fighting and combating with other men.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, the similitude is most exact.\n",

      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value on\n",
      "other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth,\n",
      "and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from the\n",
      "heaven of pleasure? Does he not call the other pleasures necessary,\n",

      "not have them?\n",
      "\n",
      "There can be no doubt of that, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in\n",
      "dispute, and the question is not which life is more or less honourable,\n",

      "shall we know who speaks truly?\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot myself tell, he said.\n",

      "\n",

      "the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of\n",
      "gain?\n",
      "\n",
      "The philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has\n",
      "of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his\n",
      "childhood upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not\n",
      "of necessity tasted--or, I should rather say, even had he desired, could\n",
      "hardly have tasted--the sweetness of learning and knowing truth.\n",

      "experience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be\n",
      "found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only.\n",
      "\n",
      "His experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any one?\n",
      "\n",
      "Far better.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not\n",
      "possessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the philosopher?\n",
      "\n",
      "What faculty?\n",
      "\n",
      "Reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "If wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of the\n",
      "lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuredly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgment of the\n",
      "ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges--\n",
      "\n",
      "The only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are\n",
      "approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the intelligent\n",
      "part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us in\n",
      "whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when he\n",
      "approves of his own life.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the\n",
      "pleasure which is next?\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer to\n",
      "himself than the money-maker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last comes the lover of gain?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust in\n",
      "this conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to\n",
      "Olympian Zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure\n",
      "except that of the wise is quite true and pure--all others are a shadow\n",
      "only; and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of\n",

      "\n",
      "Yes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?\n",
      "\n",
      "I will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Say, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is.\n",
      "\n",
      "A state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about\n",
      "either--that is what you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "You remember what people say when they are sick?\n",
      "\n",
      "What do they say?\n",
      "\n",
      "That after all nothing is pleasanter than health. But then they never\n",
      "knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I know, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must have heard them\n",
      "say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and\n",
      "cessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them\n",
      "as the greatest pleasure?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to be at\n",
      "rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will be\n",
      "painful?\n",
      "\n",
      "Doubtless, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be\n",
      "pain?\n",
      "\n",
      "So it would seem.\n",
      "\n",
      "But can that which is neither become both?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should say not.\n",
      "\n",
      "And both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they not?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion,\n",
      "and in a mean between them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "How, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is\n",
      "pleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain?\n",
      "\n",
      "Impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "This then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is to say, the\n",
      "rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful,\n",
      "and painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these\n",
      "representations, when tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real\n",
      "but a sort of imposition?\n",
      "\n",
      "That is the inference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and\n",
      "you will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that pleasure\n",
      "is only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are they, he said, and where shall I find them?\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many of them: take as an example the pleasures of smell, which\n",
      "are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a moment, and\n",
      "when they depart leave no pain behind them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the\n",
      "cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.\n",
      "\n",
      "No.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul\n",

      "\n",
      "That is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like\n",
      "nature?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",

      "Shall I give you an illustration of them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "You would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and\n",
      "middle region?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would\n",
      "he not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the middle\n",
      "and sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in the\n",
      "upper region, if he has never seen the true upper world?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?\n",
      "\n",
      "But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine,\n",
      "that he was descending?\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "All that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle\n",
      "and lower regions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",

      "Then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth, as\n",
      "they have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have wrong\n",
      "ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so that when\n",
      "they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think\n",
      "the pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when\n",
      "drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state, they firmly\n",
      "believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure; they,\n",
      "not knowing pleasure, err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain,\n",
      "which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white--can you\n",

      "\n",
      "No, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite.\n",

      "An easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat\n",
      "might be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of\n",
      "turning a mirror round and round--you would soon enough make the sun and\n",
      "the heavens, and the earth and yourself, and other animals and plants,\n",
      "and all the other things of which we were just now speaking, in the\n",
      "mirror.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; but they would be appearances only.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very good, I said, you are coming to the point now. And the painter too\n",
      "is, as I conceive, just such another--a creator of appearances, is he\n",
      "not?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then I suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue. And yet\n",
      "there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, but not a real bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what of the maker of the bed? were you not saying that he too makes,\n",
      "not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the bed,\n",
      "but only a particular bed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I did.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true\n",
      "existence, but only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to\n",
      "say that the work of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has\n",
      "real existence, he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, he replied, philosophers would say that he was not speaking\n",
      "the truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "No wonder, then, that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "No wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire\n",
      "who this imitator is?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you please.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made by\n",
      "God, as I think that we may say--for no one else can be the maker?\n",
      "\n",
      "No.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is another which is the work of the carpenter?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the work of the painter is a third?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who\n",
      "superintend them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, there are three of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "God, whether from choice or from necessity, made one bed in nature and\n",
      "one only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever\n",
      "will be made by God.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because even if He had made but two, a third would still appear behind\n",
      "them which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be the\n",
      "ideal bed and not the two others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "God knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed, not\n",
      "a particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed\n",
      "which is essentially and by nature one only.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we believe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shall we, then, speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the bed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation He is\n",
      "the author of this and of all other things.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what shall we say of the carpenter--is not he also the maker of the\n",
      "bed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But would you call the painter a creator and maker?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of\n",
      "that which the others make.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature\n",
      "an imitator?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other\n",
      "imitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?\n",
      "\n",
      "That appears to be so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then about the imitator we are agreed. And what about the painter?--I\n",
      "would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which\n",
      "originally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?\n",
      "\n",
      "The latter.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they are or as they appear? you have still to determine this.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view,\n",
      "obliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will\n",
      "appear different, but there is no difference in reality. And the same of\n",
      "all things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, the difference is only apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now let me ask you another question: Which is the art of painting\n",
      "designed to be--an imitation of things as they are, or as they\n",
      "appear--of appearance or of reality?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the imitator, I said, is a long way off the truth, and can do all\n",
      "things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that part\n",
      "an image. For example: A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter, or\n",
      "any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if he is\n",
      "a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he shows\n",
      "them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will fancy\n",
      "that they are looking at a real carpenter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all\n",
      "the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing\n",
      "with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man--whoever tells us\n",
      "this, I think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who\n",
      "is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and\n",
      "whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyse\n",
      "the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and Homer, who\n",
      "is at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue as well\n",
      "as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot compose\n",
      "well unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this knowledge\n",
      "can never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also there may\n",
      "not be a similar illusion. Perhaps they may have come across imitators\n",
      "and been deceived by them; they may not have remembered when they saw\n",
      "their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the\n",
      "truth, and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth,\n",
      "because they are appearances only and not realities? Or, after all, they\n",
      "may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about which\n",
      "they seem to the many to speak so well?\n",
      "\n",
      "The question, he said, should by all means be considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as\n",
      "well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making\n",
      "branch? Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life,\n",
      "as if he had nothing higher in him?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should say not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be interested in\n",
      "realities and not in imitations; and would desire to leave as memorials\n",
      "of himself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of\n",
      "encomiums, he would prefer to be the theme of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour and\n",
      "profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, I said, we must put a question to Homer; not about medicine, or\n",
      "any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer: we are not\n",
      "going to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured patients\n",
      "like Asclepius, or left behind him a school of medicine such as the\n",
      "Asclepiads were, or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts\n",
      "at second-hand; but we have a right to know respecting military tactics,\n",
      "politics, education, which are the chiefest and noblest subjects of his\n",
      "poems, and we may fairly ask him about them. 'Friend Homer,' then we say\n",
      "to him, 'if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say\n",
      "of virtue, and not in the third--not an image maker or imitator--and\n",
      "if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in\n",
      "private or public life, tell us what State was ever better governed by\n",
      "your help? The good order of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and many\n",
      "other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others;\n",
      "but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done\n",
      "them any good? Italy and Sicily boast of Charondas, and there is Solon\n",
      "who is renowned among us; but what city has anything to say about you?'\n",
      "Is there any city which he might name?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend that\n",
      "he was a legislator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully\n",
      "by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to human\n",
      "life, such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other\n",
      "ingenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is absolutely nothing of the kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide or\n",
      "teacher of any? Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate\n",
      "with him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life, such\n",
      "as was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his\n",
      "wisdom, and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the\n",
      "order which was named after him?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing of the kind is recorded of him. For surely, Socrates,\n",
      "Creophylus, the companion of Homer, that child of flesh, whose name\n",
      "always makes us laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity,\n",
      "if, as is said, Homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own\n",
      "day when he was alive?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I replied, that is the tradition. But can you imagine, Glaucon,\n",
      "that if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind--if he\n",
      "had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator--can you imagine,\n",
      "I say, that he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and\n",
      "loved by them? Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus of Ceos, and a host of\n",
      "others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries: 'You will never be\n",
      "able to manage either your own house or your own State until you appoint\n",
      "us to be your ministers of education'--and this ingenious device of\n",
      "theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their companions\n",
      "all but carry them about on their shoulders. And is it conceivable that\n",
      "the contemporaries of Homer, or again of Hesiod, would have allowed\n",
      "either of them to go about as rhapsodists, if they had really been able\n",
      "to make mankind virtuous? Would they not have been as unwilling to part\n",
      "with them as with gold, and have compelled them to stay at home with\n",
      "them? Or, if the master would not stay, then the disciples would have\n",
      "followed him about everywhere, until they had got education enough?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, Socrates, that, I think, is quite true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning\n",
      "with Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the like,\n",
      "but the truth they never reach? The poet is like a painter who, as\n",
      "we have already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though he\n",
      "understands nothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for\n",
      "those who know no more than he does, and judge only by colours and\n",
      "figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quite so.\n",
      "\n",
      "In like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay on\n",
      "the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their nature only\n",
      "enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant as he is,\n",
      "and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of cobbling,\n",
      "or of military tactics, or of anything else, in metre and harmony and\n",
      "rhythm, he speaks very well--such is the sweet influence which melody\n",
      "and rhythm by nature have. And I think that you must have observed again\n",
      "and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped\n",
      "of the colours which music puts upon them, and recited in simple prose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only\n",
      "blooming; and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is another point: The imitator or maker of the image knows nothing\n",
      "of true existence; he knows appearances only. Am I not right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with half\n",
      "an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the worker in leather and brass will make them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? Nay,\n",
      "hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the\n",
      "horseman who knows how to use them--he knows their right form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And may we not say the same of all things?\n",
      "\n",
      "What?\n",
      "\n",
      "That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one which\n",
      "uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate or\n",
      "inanimate, and of every action of man, is relative to the use for which\n",
      "nature or the artist has intended them.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and\n",
      "he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop\n",
      "themselves in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the\n",
      "flute-maker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he\n",
      "will tell him how he ought to make them, and the other will attend to\n",
      "his instructions?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and\n",
      "badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what he is\n",
      "told by him?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "The instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it\n",
      "the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain\n",
      "from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what\n",
      "he has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "But will the imitator have either? Will he know from use whether or no\n",
      "his drawing is correct or beautiful? or will he have right opinion\n",
      "from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him\n",
      "instructions about what he should draw?\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about\n",
      "the goodness or badness of his imitations?\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about\n",
      "his own creations?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, very much the reverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "And still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing\n",
      "good or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which\n",
      "appears to be good to the ignorant multitude?\n",
      "\n",
      "Just so.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no\n",
      "knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates. Imitation is only a kind\n",
      "of play or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in Iambic or\n",
      "in Heroic verse, are imitators in the highest degree?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to be\n",
      "concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I will explain: The body which is large when seen near, appears small\n",
      "when seen at a distance?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water,\n",
      "and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to\n",
      "the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort\n",
      "of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the\n",
      "human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and\n",
      "shadow and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon us\n",
      "like magic.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the\n",
      "rescue of the human understanding--there is the beauty of them--and the\n",
      "apparent greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery\n",
      "over us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational\n",
      "principle in the soul?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "And when this principle measures and certifies that some things are\n",
      "equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an\n",
      "apparent contradiction?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "But were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible--the same\n",
      "faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same\n",
      "thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is\n",
      "not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to\n",
      "measure and calculation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of\n",
      "the soul?\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was the conclusion at which I was seeking to arrive when I said\n",
      "that painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their own\n",
      "proper work, are far removed from truth, and the companions and friends\n",
      "and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from\n",
      "reason, and that they have no true or healthy aim.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly.\n",

      "The imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has\n",
      "inferior offspring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",

      "Probably the same would be true of poetry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do not rely, I said, on a probability derived from the analogy of\n",
      "painting; but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with\n",
      "which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "By all means.\n",
      "\n",
      "We may state the question thus:--Imitation imitates the actions of men,\n",
      "whether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good or\n",
      "bad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly. Is there\n",
      "anything more?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, there is nothing else.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with\n",
      "himself--or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and\n",
      "opposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there\n",
      "not strife and inconsistency in his life? Though I need hardly raise the\n",
      "question again, for I remember that all this has been already admitted;\n",

      "Were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his\n",

      "Yes.\n",

      "Indeed, we may.\n",
      "\n",

      "to appreciate when imitated, especially at a public festival when a\n",
      "promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre. For the feeling represented\n",
      "is one to which they are strangers.\n",

      "inferior degree of truth--in this, I say, he is like him; and he is\n",
      "also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul; and\n",
      "therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a well-ordered\n",
      "State, because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings\n",
      "and impairs the reason. As in a city when the evil are permitted to have\n",
      "authority and the good are put out of the way, so in the soul of man,\n",
      "as we maintain, the imitative poet implants an evil constitution, for he\n",
      "indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of greater\n",
      "and less, but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another\n",
      "small--he is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the\n",

      "that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is\n",
      "satisfied and delighted by the poets;--the better nature in each of\n",
      "us, not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the\n",

      "praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he\n",
      "is, and making a fuss about his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure\n",
      "is a gain, and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem\n",
      "too? Few persons ever reflect, as I should imagine, that from the evil\n",
      "of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves. And so\n",
      "the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the\n",
      "misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own.\n",

      "How very true!\n",
      "\n",
      "And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests which\n",

      "instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be\n",
      "controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot deny it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, Glaucon, I said, whenever you meet with any of the eulogists\n",

      "regulate your whole life according to him, we may love and honour those\n",
      "who say these things--they are excellent people, as far as their lights\n",
      "extend; and we are ready to acknowledge that Homer is the greatest\n",
      "of poets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our\n",
      "conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only\n",
      "poetry which ought to be admitted into our State. For if you go beyond\n",
      "this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either in epic or lyric verse,\n",
      "not law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent have ever\n",
      "been deemed best, but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our State.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is most true, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this our\n",
      "defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in\n",
      "sending away out of our State an art having the tendencies which we have\n",
      "described; for reason constrained us. But that she may not impute to us\n",
      "any harshness or want of politeness, let us tell her that there is an\n",
      "ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry; of which there are many\n",
      "proofs, such as the saying of 'the yelping hound howling at her lord,'\n",
      "or of one 'mighty in the vain talk of fools,' and 'the mob of sages\n",
      "circumventing Zeus,' and the 'subtle thinkers who are beggars after\n",
      "all'; and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between\n",
      "them. Notwithstanding this, let us assure our sweet friend and the\n",
      "sister arts of imitation, that if she will only prove her title to exist\n",
      "in a well-ordered State we shall be delighted to receive her--we are\n",
      "very conscious of her charms; but we may not on that account betray the\n",
      "truth. I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her as I am,\n",
      "especially when she appears in Homer?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, indeed, I am greatly charmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but\n",
      "upon this condition only--that she make a defence of herself in lyrical\n",
      "or some other metre?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of\n",
      "poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf:\n",
      "let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States\n",
      "and to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if this\n",
      "can be proved we shall surely be the gainers--I mean, if there is a use\n",

      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said, we shall be the gainers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who are\n",
      "enamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when they\n",
      "think their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must we after\n",
      "the manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle. We too\n",
      "are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble States\n",
      "has implanted in us, and therefore we would have her appear at her best\n",
      "and truest; but so long as she is unable to make good her defence,\n",
      "this argument of ours shall be a charm to us, which we will repeat to\n",
      "ourselves while we listen to her strains; that we may not fall away into\n",
      "the childish love of her which captivates the many. At all events we\n",
      "are well aware that poetry being such as we have described is not to be\n",
      "regarded seriously as attaining to the truth; and he who listens to her,\n",
      "fearing for the safety of the city which is within him, should be on his\n",
      "guard against her seductions and make our words his law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, I quite agree with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, my dear Glaucon, for great is the issue at stake, greater\n",
      "than appears, whether a man is to be good or bad. And what will any one\n",
      "be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power, aye, or\n",
      "under the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; I have been convinced by the argument, as I believe that\n",
      "any one else would have been.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards\n",
      "which await virtue.\n",
      "\n",
      "What, are there any greater still? If there are, they must be of an\n",
      "inconceivable greatness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why, I said, what was ever great in a short time? The whole period of\n",
      "three score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison\n",
      "with eternity?\n",
      "\n",
      "Say rather 'nothing,' he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather\n",
      "than of the whole?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the whole, certainly. But why do you ask?\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and\n",
      "imperishable?\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are you\n",
      "really prepared to maintain this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I said, I ought to be, and you too--there is no difficulty in\n",
      "proving it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see a great difficulty; but I should like to hear you state this\n",
      "argument of which you make so light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Listen then.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am attending.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying\n",
      "element is the evil, and the saving and improving element the good?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; as\n",
      "ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as\n",
      "mildew is of corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in\n",
      "everything, or in almost everything, there is an inherent evil and\n",
      "disease?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "And anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, and\n",
      "at last wholly dissolves and dies?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each;\n",
      "and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will; for\n",
      "good certainly will not destroy them, nor again, that which is neither\n",
      "good nor evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "If, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption\n",
      "cannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a\n",
      "nature there is no destruction?\n",
      "\n",
      "That may be assumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now passing in\n",
      "review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.\n",
      "\n",
      "But does any of these dissolve or destroy her?--and here do not let us\n",
      "fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when\n",
      "he is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil\n",
      "of the soul. Take the analogy of the body: The evil of the body is a\n",
      "disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body; and all the\n",
      "things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through\n",
      "their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so\n",
      "destroying them. Is not this true?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the soul in like manner. Does the injustice or other evil which\n",
      "exists in the soul waste and consume her? Do they by attaching to the\n",
      "soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her\n",
      "from the body?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish\n",
      "from without through affection of external evil which could not be\n",
      "destroyed from within by a corruption of its own?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether\n",
      "staleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to\n",
      "the actual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the\n",
      "badness of food communicates corruption to the body, then we should say\n",
      "that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is\n",
      "disease, brought on by this; but that the body, being one thing, can be\n",
      "destroyed by the badness of food, which is another, and which does not\n",
      "engender any natural infection--this we shall absolutely deny?\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an evil\n",
      "of the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, can\n",
      "be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said, there is reason in that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either, then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains\n",
      "unrefuted, let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the\n",
      "knife put to the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into\n",
      "the minutest pieces, can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved\n",
      "to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things\n",
      "being done to the body; but that the soul, or anything else if not\n",
      "destroyed by an internal evil, can be destroyed by an external one, is\n",
      "not to be affirmed by any man.\n",
      "\n",
      "And surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls of men\n",
      "become more unjust in consequence of death.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul\n",
      "boldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become more\n",
      "evil and unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, I suppose that\n",
      "injustice, like disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust, and\n",
      "that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of\n",
      "destruction which evil has, and which kills them sooner or later, but\n",
      "in quite another way from that in which, at present, the wicked receive\n",
      "death at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will not\n",
      "be so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil. But I\n",
      "rather suspect the opposite to be the truth, and that injustice which,\n",
      "if it have the power, will murder others, keeps the murderer alive--aye,\n",
      "and well awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place from being a\n",
      "house of death.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, I said; if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable\n",
      "to kill or destroy her, hardly will that which is appointed to be the\n",
      "destruction of some other body, destroy a soul or anything else except\n",
      "that of which it was appointed to be the destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that can hardly be.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether inherent\n",
      "or external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be\n",
      "immortal?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is the conclusion, I said; and, if a true conclusion, then the\n",
      "souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not\n",
      "diminish in number. Neither will they increase, for the increase of the\n",
      "immortal natures must come from something mortal, and all things would\n",
      "thus end in immortality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this we cannot believe--reason will not allow us--any more than we\n",
      "can believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety and\n",
      "difference and dissimilarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do you mean? he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the fairest\n",
      "of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there are\n",
      "many other proofs; but to see her as she really is, not as we now behold\n",
      "her, marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you must\n",
      "contemplate her with the eye of reason, in her original purity; and\n",
      "then her beauty will be revealed, and justice and injustice and all the\n",
      "things which we have described will be manifested more clearly. Thus\n",
      "far, we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present,\n",
      "but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition\n",
      "which may be compared to that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose original\n",
      "image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken\n",
      "off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways, and\n",
      "incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones, so\n",
      "that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form.\n",
      "And the soul which we behold is in a similar condition, disfigured by\n",
      "ten thousand ills. But not there, Glaucon, not there must we look.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where then?\n",
      "\n",
      "At her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and what society and\n",
      "converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal\n",
      "and eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly\n",
      "following this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of\n",
      "the ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and shells\n",
      "and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her\n",
      "because she feeds upon earth, and is overgrown by the good things of\n",
      "this life as they are termed: then you would see her as she is, and know\n",
      "whether she have one shape only or many, or what her nature is. Of her\n",
      "affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life I think\n",
      "that we have now said enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "True, he replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "And thus, I said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument; we\n",
      "have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which, as you\n",
      "were saying, are to be found in Homer and Hesiod; but justice in her own\n",
      "nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature. Let a\n",
      "man do what is just, whether he have the ring of Gyges or not, and even\n",
      "if in addition to the ring of Gyges he put on the helmet of Hades.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, Glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how\n",
      "many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues\n",
      "procure to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after death.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly not, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?\n",
      "\n",
      "What did I borrow?\n",
      "\n",
      "The assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust\n",
      "just: for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case\n",
      "could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission\n",
      "ought to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure\n",
      "justice might be weighed against pure injustice. Do you remember?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should be much to blame if I had forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, as the cause is decided, I demand on behalf of justice that the\n",
      "estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge\n",
      "to be her due should now be restored to her by us; since she has been\n",
      "shown to confer reality, and not to deceive those who truly possess her,\n",
      "let what has been taken from her be given back, that so she may win that\n",
      "palm of appearance which is hers also, and which she gives to her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The demand, he said, is just.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first place, I said--and this is the first thing which you will\n",
      "have to give back--the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known\n",
      "to the gods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Granted.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the other\n",
      "the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all\n",
      "things at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary\n",
      "consequence of former sins?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in\n",
      "poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will\n",
      "in the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods\n",
      "have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like\n",
      "God, as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of\n",
      "virtue?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; if he is like God he will surely not be neglected by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the just?\n",
      "\n",
      "That is my conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "And what do they receive of men? Look at things as they really are, and\n",
      "you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners, who run\n",
      "well from the starting-place to the goal but not back again from the\n",
      "goal: they go off at a great pace, but in the end only look foolish,\n",
      "slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders, and without\n",
      "a crown; but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize\n",
      "and is crowned. And this is the way with the just; he who endures to the\n",
      "end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report\n",
      "and carries off the prize which men have to bestow.\n",
      "\n",
      "True.\n",
      "\n",
      "And now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you\n",
      "were attributing to the fortunate unjust. I shall say of them, what you\n",
      "were saying of the others, that as they grow older, they become rulers\n",
      "in their own city if they care to be; they marry whom they like and give\n",
      "in marriage to whom they will; all that you said of the others I now say\n",
      "of these. And, on the other hand, of the unjust I say that the greater\n",
      "number, even though they escape in their youth, are found out at last\n",
      "and look foolish at the end of their course, and when they come to be\n",
      "old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen; they are\n",
      "beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite, as you truly\n",
      "term them; they will be racked and have their eyes burned out, as you\n",
      "were saying. And you may suppose that I have repeated the remainder of\n",
      "your tale of horrors. But will you let me assume, without reciting them,\n",
      "that these things are true?\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly, he said, what you say is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "These, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed\n",
      "upon the just by gods and men in this present life, in addition to the\n",
      "other good things which justice of herself provides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, he said; and they are fair and lasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet, I said, all these are as nothing either in number or greatness\n",
      "in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and\n",
      "unjust after death. And you ought to hear them, and then both just and\n",
      "unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the\n",
      "argument owes to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speak, he said; there are few things which I would more gladly hear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which\n",
      "Odysseus tells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero,\n",
      "Er the son of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle,\n",
      "and ten days afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up\n",
      "already in a state of corruption, his body was found unaffected by\n",
      "decay, and carried away home to be buried. And on the twelfth day, as he\n",
      "was lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and told them what he\n",
      "had seen in the other world. He said that when his soul left the body\n",
      "he went on a journey with a great company, and that they came to a\n",
      "mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth; they\n",
      "were near together, and over against them were two other openings in the\n",
      "heaven above. In the intermediate space there were judges seated, who\n",
      "commanded the just, after they had given judgment on them and had bound\n",
      "their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the heavenly way on the\n",
      "right hand; and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend\n",
      "by the lower way on the left hand; these also bore the symbols of their\n",
      "deeds, but fastened on their backs. He drew near, and they told him that\n",
      "he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world\n",
      "to men, and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen\n",
      "in that place. Then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at\n",
      "either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them;\n",
      "and at the two other openings other souls, some ascending out of the\n",
      "earth dusty and worn with travel, some descending out of heaven clean\n",
      "and bright. And arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a\n",
      "long journey, and they went forth with gladness into the meadow, where\n",
      "they encamped as at a festival; and those who knew one another embraced\n",
      "and conversed, the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about\n",
      "the things above, and the souls which came from heaven about the things\n",
      "beneath. And they told one another of what had happened by the way,\n",
      "those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things\n",
      "which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth\n",
      "(now the journey lasted a thousand years), while those from above were\n",
      "describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty. The\n",
      "story, Glaucon, would take too long to tell; but the sum was this:--He\n",
      "said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered\n",
      "tenfold; or once in a hundred years--such being reckoned to be the\n",
      "length of man's life, and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a\n",
      "thousand years. If, for example, there were any who had been the cause\n",
      "of many deaths, or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies, or been\n",
      "guilty of any other evil behaviour, for each and all of their offences\n",
      "they received punishment ten times over, and the rewards of beneficence\n",
      "and justice and holiness were in the same proportion. I need hardly\n",
      "repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon\n",
      "as they were born. Of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of\n",
      "murderers, there were retributions other and greater far which he\n",
      "described. He mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits\n",
      "asked another, 'Where is Ardiaeus the Great?' (Now this Ardiaeus lived\n",
      "a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the tyrant of\n",
      "some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder\n",
      "brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)\n",
      "The answer of the other spirit was: 'He comes not hither and will never\n",
      "come. And this,' said he, 'was one of the dreadful sights which we\n",
      "ourselves witnessed. We were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having\n",
      "completed all our experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden\n",
      "Ardiaeus appeared and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and\n",
      "there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been\n",
      "great criminals: they were just, as they fancied, about to return into\n",
      "the upper world, but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a roar,\n",
      "whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been\n",
      "sufficiently punished tried to ascend; and then wild men of fiery\n",
      "aspect, who were standing by and heard the sound, seized and carried\n",
      "them off; and Ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand, and\n",
      "threw them down and flayed them with scourges, and dragged them along\n",
      "the road at the side, carding them on thorns like wool, and declaring\n",
      "to the passers-by what were their crimes, and that they were being taken\n",
      "away to be cast into hell.' And of all the many terrors which they had\n",
      "endured, he said that there was none like the terror which each of them\n",
      "felt at that moment, lest they should hear the voice; and when there was\n",
      "silence, one by one they ascended with exceeding joy. These, said Er,\n",
      "were the penalties and retributions, and there were blessings as great.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days,\n",
      "on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and, on the\n",
      "fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they could\n",
      "see from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending right\n",
      "through the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour resembling the\n",
      "rainbow, only brighter and purer; another day's journey brought them to\n",
      "the place, and there, in the midst of the light, they saw the ends of\n",
      "the chains of heaven let down from above: for this light is the belt\n",
      "of heaven, and holds together the circle of the universe, like the\n",
      "under-girders of a trireme. From these ends is extended the spindle of\n",
      "Necessity, on which all the revolutions turn. The shaft and hook of this\n",
      "spindle are made of steel, and the whorl is made partly of steel and\n",
      "also partly of other materials. Now the whorl is in form like the whorl\n",
      "used on earth; and the description of it implied that there is one large\n",
      "hollow whorl which is quite scooped out, and into this is fitted another\n",
      "lesser one, and another, and another, and four others, making eight\n",
      "in all, like vessels which fit into one another; the whorls show their\n",
      "edges on the upper side, and on their lower side all together form one\n",
      "continuous whorl. This is pierced by the spindle, which is driven home\n",
      "through the centre of the eighth. The first and outermost whorl has the\n",
      "rim broadest, and the seven inner whorls are narrower, in the following\n",
      "proportions--the sixth is next to the first in size, the fourth next\n",
      "to the sixth; then comes the eighth; the seventh is fifth, the fifth\n",
      "is sixth, the third is seventh, last and eighth comes the second.\n",
      "The largest (or fixed stars) is spangled, and the seventh (or sun) is\n",
      "brightest; the eighth (or moon) coloured by the reflected light of the\n",
      "seventh; the second and fifth (Saturn and Mercury) are in colour like\n",
      "one another, and yellower than the preceding; the third (Venus) has the\n",
      "whitest light; the fourth (Mars) is reddish; the sixth (Jupiter) is in\n",
      "whiteness second. Now the whole spindle has the same motion; but, as the\n",
      "whole revolves in one direction, the seven inner circles move slowly in\n",
      "the other, and of these the swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness\n",
      "are the seventh, sixth, and fifth, which move together; third in\n",
      "swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion\n",
      "the fourth; the third appeared fourth and the second fifth. The spindle\n",
      "turns on the knees of Necessity; and on the upper surface of each circle\n",
      "is a siren, who goes round with them, hymning a single tone or note. The\n",
      "eight together form one harmony; and round about, at equal intervals,\n",
      "there is another band, three in number, each sitting upon her throne:\n",
      "these are the Fates, daughters of Necessity, who are clothed in white\n",
      "robes and have chaplets upon their heads, Lachesis and Clotho\n",
      "and Atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony of the\n",
      "sirens--Lachesis singing of the past, Clotho of the present, Atropos of\n",
      "the future; Clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right\n",
      "hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle, and\n",
      "Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones, and\n",
      "Lachesis laying hold of either in turn, first with one hand and then\n",
      "with the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to\n",
      "Lachesis; but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in\n",
      "order; then he took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of\n",
      "lives, and having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: 'Hear the\n",
      "word of Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new\n",
      "cycle of life and mortality. Your genius will not be allotted to you,\n",
      "but you will choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot\n",
      "have the first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his\n",
      "destiny. Virtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will\n",
      "have more or less of her; the responsibility is with the chooser--God\n",
      "is justified.' When the Interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots\n",
      "indifferently among them all, and each of them took up the lot which\n",
      "fell near him, all but Er himself (he was not allowed), and each as\n",
      "he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained. Then the\n",
      "Interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives; and\n",
      "there were many more lives than the souls present, and they were of all\n",
      "sorts. There were lives of every animal and of man in every condition.\n",
      "And there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the tyrant's life,\n",
      "others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and\n",
      "exile and beggary; and there were lives of famous men, some who were\n",
      "famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and\n",
      "success in games, or, again, for their birth and the qualities of their\n",
      "ancestors; and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite\n",
      "qualities. And of women likewise; there was not, however, any definite\n",
      "character in them, because the soul, when choosing a new life, must of\n",
      "necessity become different. But there was every other quality, and\n",
      "the all mingled with one another, and also with elements of wealth and\n",
      "poverty, and disease and health; and there were mean states also. And\n",
      "here, my dear Glaucon, is the supreme peril of our human state; and\n",
      "therefore the utmost care should be taken. Let each one of us leave\n",
      "every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only, if\n",
      "peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make\n",
      "him able to learn and discern between good and evil, and so to choose\n",
      "always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity. He should\n",
      "consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned\n",
      "severally and collectively upon virtue; he should know what the effect\n",
      "of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul,\n",
      "and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth,\n",
      "of private and public station, of strength and weakness, of cleverness\n",
      "and dullness, and of all the natural and acquired gifts of the soul, and\n",
      "the operation of them when conjoined; he will then look at the nature of\n",
      "the soul, and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be\n",
      "able to determine which is the better and which is the worse; and so\n",
      "he will choose, giving the name of evil to the life which will make his\n",
      "soul more unjust, and good to the life which will make his soul more\n",
      "just; all else he will disregard. For we have seen and know that this is\n",
      "the best choice both in life and after death. A man must take with him\n",
      "into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right, that there\n",
      "too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements\n",
      "of evil, lest, coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies, he do\n",
      "irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself; but let him\n",
      "know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side, as\n",
      "far as possible, not only in this life but in all that which is to come.\n",
      "For this is the way of happiness.\n",

      "And according to the report of the messenger from the other world this\n",
      "was what the prophet said at the time: 'Even for the last comer, if he\n",
      "chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and\n",
      "not undesirable existence. Let not him who chooses first be careless,\n",
      "and let not the last despair.' And when he had spoken, he who had the\n",
      "first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny;\n",
      "his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not\n",
      "thought out the whole matter before he chose, and did not at first\n",
      "sight perceive that he was fated, among other evils, to devour his own\n",
      "children. But when he had time to reflect, and saw what was in the lot,\n",
      "he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice, forgetting the\n",
      "proclamation of the prophet; for, instead of throwing the blame of his\n",
      "misfortune on himself, he accused chance and the gods, and everything\n",
      "rather than himself. Now he was one of those who came from heaven, and\n",
      "in a former life had dwelt in a well-ordered State, but his virtue was\n",
      "a matter of habit only, and he had no philosophy. And it was true of\n",
      "others who were similarly overtaken, that the greater number of them\n",
      "came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial,\n",
      "whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and\n",
      "seen others suffer, were not in a hurry to choose. And owing to this\n",
      "inexperience of theirs, and also because the lot was a chance, many of\n",
      "the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good.\n",
      "For if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself\n",
      "from the first to sound philosophy, and had been moderately fortunate\n",
      "in the number of the lot, he might, as the messenger reported, be happy\n",
      "here, and also his journey to another life and return to this, instead\n",
      "of being rough and underground, would be smooth and heavenly. Most\n",
      "curious, he said, was the spectacle--sad and laughable and strange; for\n",
      "the choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of\n",
      "a previous life. There he saw the soul which had once been Orpheus\n",
      "choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women, hating\n",
      "to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers; he beheld\n",
      "also the soul of Thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale; birds, on\n",
      "the other hand, like the swan and other musicians, wanting to be men.\n",
      "The soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion, and\n",
      "this was the soul of Ajax the son of Telamon, who would not be a man,\n",
      "remembering the injustice which was done him in the judgment about the\n",
      "arms. The next was Agamemnon, who took the life of an eagle, because,\n",
      "like Ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings. About\n",
      "the middle came the lot of Atalanta; she, seeing the great fame of\n",
      "an athlete, was unable to resist the temptation: and after her there\n",
      "followed the soul of Epeus the son of Panopeus passing into the nature\n",
      "of a woman cunning in the arts; and far away among the last who chose,\n",
      "the soul of the jester Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey.\n",
      "There came also the soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and\n",
      "his lot happened to be the last of them all. Now the recollection of\n",
      "former toils had disenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for\n",
      "a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no\n",
      "cares; he had some difficulty in finding this, which was lying about and\n",
      "had been neglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said that\n",
      "he would have done the same had his lot been first instead of last,\n",
      "and that he was delighted to have it. And not only did men pass into\n",
      "animals, but I must also mention that there were animals tame and wild\n",
      "who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures--the\n",
      "good into the gentle and the evil into the savage, in all sorts of\n",
      "combinations.\n",

      "their choice to Lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they had\n",
      "severally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller\n",
      "of the choice: this genius led the souls first to Clotho, and drew\n",
      "them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus\n",
      "ratifying the destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to\n",
      "this, carried them to Atropos, who spun the threads and made them\n",
      "irreversible, whence without turning round they passed beneath the\n",
      "throne of Necessity; and when they had all passed, they marched on in a\n",
      "scorching heat to the plain of Forgetfulness, which was a barren waste\n",
      "destitute of trees and verdure; and then towards evening they encamped\n",
      "by the river of Unmindfulness, whose water no vessel can hold; of this\n",
      "they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity, and those who were\n",
      "not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary; and each one as he\n",
      "drank forgot all things. Now after they had gone to rest, about the\n",
      "middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake, and then\n",
      "in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their\n",
      "birth, like stars shooting. He himself was hindered from drinking the\n",
      "water. But in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he\n",
